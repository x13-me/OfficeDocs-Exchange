# Policy templates from Microsoft partners in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The data loss prevention (DLP) features can help you identify and monitor many categories of sensitive information. As you configure your DLP polices, you have the option to import a file from a source outside Microsoft Exchange to use as a DLP policy template. Microsoft partner companies can develop and distribute these types of templates. This topic will be updated with a link to help you find these companies once they are available.

DLP policy template files that can be imported are XML documents that contain instructions for scanning and analyzing message data. These templates can contain new sensitive information definitions in classification rule packages, or they can utilize rule packages that exist within Exchange already. The XML documents must adhere to a Microsoft-defined XML schema definition. For more information about the schema definition, see [Define your own DLP templates and information types](define-your-own-dlp-templates-and-information-types-exchange-2013-help.md).
