# Configure global address list properties in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:**: Exchange Server 2013_

This topic explains how to modify the settings of a global address list (GAL).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 5 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address lists" entry in the [Email Address and Address Book Permissions](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/1c1de09d-16ef-4424-9bfb-eb7edffbc8c2.aspx) topic.

- You can't edit the settings of the default GAL.

- You can't use the Exchange Administration Center (EAC) to perform this procedure. You must use the Shell.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center in Exchange 2013](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to configure GAL properties

This example assigns a new name, FourthCoffee, to the GAL that has the GUID 96d0c505-eba8-4103-ad4f-577a1bf4ad7b.

```powershell
Set-GlobalAddressList -Identity 96d0c505-eba8-4103-ad4f-577a1bf4ad7b -Name FourthCoffee
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using precanned conditional filter properties, the value for the _IncludedRecipients_ parameter can't be blank.

This example changes the recipients who will be included in the Fourth Coffee global GAL to those whose company is set to Fourth Coffee.

```powershell
Set-GlobalAddressList -Identity Fourth Coffee -RecipientFilter {Company -eq "Fourth Coffee"}
```
