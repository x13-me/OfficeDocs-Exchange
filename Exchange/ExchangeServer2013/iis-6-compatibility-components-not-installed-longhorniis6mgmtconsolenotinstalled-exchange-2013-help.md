Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 Setup cannot continue its attempt to install the Client Access Server server role, the Mailbox server role, or the Exchange 2007 Administrative Tools on the following Windows operating systems:

  - Windows Server 2008 R2

  - Windows Server 2008

  - Windows 7 (Administrative Tools only)

  - Windows Vista (Administrative Tools only)

This problem occurs because the Internet Information Server (IIS) 6 Metabase Compatibility component and the IIS 6 Management Console component are not installed.

Exchange 2007 setup requires that the computer on which you are installing the Exchange 2007 Client Access server role, the Mailbox server role, or the Exchange 2007 Administrative Tools has the IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility component and the IIS 6 Management Console component installed.

To resolve this problem, install the IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility component on the destination computer, and then rerun Microsoft Exchange Setup.
