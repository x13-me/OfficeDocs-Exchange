# View performance counters for messaging records management

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You can use Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe) to select and view performance counters for messaging records management (MRM). By using performance counters, you can monitor the Managed Folder Assistant while it runs resource-intensive MRM processes.

For a list of performance counters for MRM, see [Performance counters for messaging records management](./performance-counters-for-/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/messaging-records-management).

Looking for other tasks related to monitoring MRM? Check out [Monitoring messaging records management](./monitoring-/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/messaging-records-management).

## Use Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor to view performance counters for MRM

To perform this procedure, the account you use must be delegated membership in the local Administrators group.

1. To start Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor, click **Start**, click **Run**, and then type **perfmon**.

2. In the console tree, navigate to **Monitoring Tools** \> **Performance Monitor**.

3. Click the plus sign (+) button on the toolbar. The **Add Counters** dialog box appears.

4. From the **Select counter from computer** list, select one of the following options:

      - If you are performing this procedure on a local computer, select **\<Local computer\>**. This is the default selection.

      - If you are performing this procedure remotely, select the server you want to monitor.

5. In the list of performance counters, expand **MSExchange Assistants - Per Database** or the **MSExchange Managed Folder Assistant**.

6. Select the performance counters you want to monitor.
