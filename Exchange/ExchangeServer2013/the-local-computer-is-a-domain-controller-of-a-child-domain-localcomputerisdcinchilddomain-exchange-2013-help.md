Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the local computer is a domain controller for a child domain.

Exchange 2007 setup will not install on to a domain controller for a child domain unless the domain controller is a global catalog server.

To resolve this issue, promote the domain controller to a global catalog server or install Exchange 2007 to a non-domain controller, a member server, in the child domain, and then rerun the Microsoft Exchange setup.

**To correct this warning by making the Exchange server a global catalog server**

1. On the domain controller, click **Start**, point to **Programs**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Active Directory Sites and Services**.

2. In the console tree, double-click **Sites**, double-click the name of the site, and then double-click **Servers**.

3. Double-click the target domain controller.

4. In the results pane, right-click **NTDS Settings**, and then click **Properties**.

5. On the **General** tab, click to select the **Global catalog** check box.

6. Restart the domain controller.
