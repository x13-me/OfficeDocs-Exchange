# About Exchange documentation in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You're reading a collection of conceptual and procedural topics organized by subject or by technologies used by Microsoft Exchange. You can access each topic directly from the table of contents in the left pane, from a link in another Help topic, from the results of a search, or from your own custom list of favorite topics.

Other information related to Exchange documentation is in [Third-party copyright notices](third-party-copyright-notices-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Where to find Exchange documentation

[Exchange documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/) is your primary gateway to in-depth technical information about Microsoft Exchange.

The [Exchange Team Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/bg-p/Exchange) contains technical articles written by the Exchange Team, as well as product announcements and updates. The blog is an excellent way to interact with the Exchange Team. We read and respond to your feedback and comments.

If you're an admin for an Exchange hybrid or Exchange Online deployment, you may also be interested in [Manage Microsoft 365 and Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/Office365/).
