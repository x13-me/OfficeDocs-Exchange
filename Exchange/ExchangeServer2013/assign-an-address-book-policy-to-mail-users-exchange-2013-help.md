# Assign an address book policy to mail users in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

After you create an address book policy (ABP), you must assign it to mailbox users. Users aren't assigned a default ABP when their user account is created. If you don't assign an ABP to a user, the global address list (GAL) for your entire organization will be accessible to the user through Outlook and Outlook Web App. To learn more, see [Address book policies](address-book-policies-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to assign an ABP to mailbox users

```powershell
Set-Mailbox -Identity joe@fabrikam.com -AddressBookPolicy "All Fabrikam"
```

This example assigns the ABP ABP_EngineeringDepartment to all mailbox users whose `CustomAttribute11` value contains "Engineering Department".

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -Filter {(CustomAttribute11 -like "Engineering Department")} | Set-Mailbox -AddressBookPolicy ABP_EngineeringDepartment
```
