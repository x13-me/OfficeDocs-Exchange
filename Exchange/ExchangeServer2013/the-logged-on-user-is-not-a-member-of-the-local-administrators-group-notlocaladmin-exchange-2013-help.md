Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the logged-on user is not a member of the local computer's administrators group.

Exchange 2007 setup requires that the logged-on user who installs Microsoft Exchange has full access to the local computer.

To resolve this issue, log on to the computer by using an account that has local administrator access and then rerun Microsoft Exchange setup.
