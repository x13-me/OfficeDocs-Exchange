## What do you want to do?

## Add members to a role group

To give a user the permissions that are granted by a role group, you need to add the user, or a universal security group (USG), or another role group that the user is a member of, as a member of the role group.

## Use the EAC to add members to a role group

1.  In the Exchange Administration Center (EAC), navigate to **Permissions** \> **Admin Roles**.

2.  Select the role group you want to add members to, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/JJ218640.6f53ccb2-1f13-4c02-bea0-30690e6ea71d(EXCHG.150).gif "Edit icon").

3.  In the **Members** section, click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/JJ218640.c1e75329-d6d7-4073-a27d-498590bbb558(EXCHG.150).gif "Add Icon").

4.  Select the users, USGs, or other role groups you want to add to the role group, click **Add**, and then click **OK**.

5.  Click **Save** to save the changes to the role group.

## Use the Shell to add members to a role group

To add a role group member, see the [Examples](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/dd638207\(exchg.150\)#examples) section in [Add-RoleGroupMember](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd638207\(v=exchg.150\)).

To add multiple role group members or to replace the role group membership entirely, see the [Examples](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/dd638116\(exchg.150\)#examples) section in [Update-RoleGroupMember](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd638116\(v=exchg.150\)).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have successfully added one or more members to a role group, do the following:

1.  In the EAC, navigate to **Permissions** \> **Admin Roles**.

2.  Select the role group you added members to.

3.  In the role group details pane, verify that the members you added are listed.

## Remove members from a role group

To remove the permissions granted by a role group from a user, you need to remove the user, or the universal security group (USG) the user is a member of, from the role group's membership.

## Use the EAC to remove members from a role group

1.  In the EAC, navigate to **Permissions** \> **Admin Roles**.
