# Add-ins for Outlook in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Add-ins for Outlook are applications that extend the usefulness of Outlook clients by adding information or tools that your users can use without having to leave Outlook. Add-ins are built by third-party developers and can be installed either from a file or URL or from the Office Store. By default, all users can install add-ins. Exchange administrators can use Roles to control users' ability to install add-ins.

> [!TIP]
> For information about add-ins for Outlook from an end-user perspective, check out the Help topic [Installed add-ins](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=282387) at Office.com. That topic provides an overview of the add-ins and also shows you some of the add-ins for Outlook that may be installed by default. 

## Office Store add-ins and custom add-ins

Outlook clients supports a variety of add-ins that are available through the Office Store. Outlook also supports custom add-ins that you can create and distribute to users in your organization. 

> [!NOTE]
> Access to the Office Store isn't supported for mailboxes or organizations in specific regions. If you don't see **Add from the Office Store** as an option in the **Exchange admin center** under **Organization** \> **Add-ins** \> **New** ![Add Icon](../ExchangeOnline/media/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.gif), you may be able to install an add-in for Outlook from a URL or file location. For more information, contact your service provider. 

> [!NOTE]
> Some add-ins for Outlook are installed by default. Default add-ins for Outlook only activate on English language content. For example, German postal addresses in the message body won't activate the Bing Maps add-in. 

## Add-in access and installation

By default, all users can install and remove add-ins. Exchange administrators have a number of controls available for managing add-ins and users' access to them. Administrators can disable users from installing add-ins that are not downloaded from the Office Store (instead they are "side loaded" from a file or URL). Administrators can also disable users from installing Office Store add-ins, and from installing add-ins on behalf of other users. It is also possible to assign users to a role that allows them to install add-ins for your organization or for a subset of users in your organization.

To prevent users from installing an add-in that isn't from the Office Store, remove the **My Custom Apps** role from them. To disable users from installing add-ins from the Office Store, remove the **My Marketplace Apps** role from them. For more details, see [Specify the administrators and users who can install and manage add-ins for Outlook](specify-who-can-install-and-manage-add-ins-2013-help.md).

To install add-ins for some or all users in your organization, see [Install or remove add-ins for Outlook for your organization](install-or-remove-outlook-add-ins-2013-help.md).

If required, you can limit availability of an add-in to specific users in your organization. For more information, see [Manage user access to add-ins for Outlook](manage-user-access-to-add-ins-2013-help.md). 

### Common administrative tasks with add-ins for Outlook

There are a couple of common scenarios that Exchange administrators manage in their organizations.

If you want to prevent end users from installing add-ins for Outlook on all Outlook clients, make the following changes to roles in the Exchange admin center:

- To prevent users from installing Office Store add-ins, remove the **My Marketplace** role from them. 

- To prevent users from loading add-ins from sources other than the Office Store, remove the **My Custom Apps** role from them. 

- To prevent users from installing all add-ins, remove both of the above roles from them.

See [Specify the administrators and users who can install and manage add-ins for Outlook](specify-who-can-install-and-manage-add-ins-2013-help.md) for more information. 

If your end users are currently able to access add-ins and you want to remove that access, use the **Get-App** cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell to see which add-ins each user has installed, and then use the **Remove-App** cmdlet to remove any add-ins from one or more users.

## Allow administrators and users to install add-ins

You can specify which administrators in your organization have permission to install and manage add-ins for Outlook. You can also specify which users in your organization have permission to install and manage add-ins for their own use. For more information, see [Specify the administrators and users who can install and manage add-ins for Outlook](specify-who-can-install-and-manage-add-ins-2013-help.md).
