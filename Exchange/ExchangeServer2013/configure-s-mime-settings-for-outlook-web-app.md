# Configure S/MIME settings for Outlook Web App in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

As an Exchange administrator, you can set up Outlook Web App to allow sending and receiving S/MIME-protected messages. Use the **Get-SmimeConfig** and **Set-SmimeConfig** cmdlets to view and manage this feature in the Exchange Management Shell. To open the Exchange Management Shell, see [Open the Exchange Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/open-the-exchange-management-shell).

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-SmimeConfig](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-smimeconfig) and [Set-SmimeConfig](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-smimeconfig).

S/MIME in Outlook Web App in Exchange 2013 is only supported in Internet Explorer.
