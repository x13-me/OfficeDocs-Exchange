# Remove an In-Place eDiscovery search in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:**: Exchange Server 2013_

In Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, you can use In-Place eDiscovery to search mailbox content. You can remove an In-Place eDiscovery search at any time. When you remove an In-Place eDiscovery search, search results are removed from the Discovery mailbox.

> [!CAUTION]
> Deleting an In-Place eDiscovery search will remove any search results copied to a Discovery mailbox.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to completion: 2-5 minutes.

- To remove an In-Place eDiscovery search that has In-Place Hold enabled, you must first remove the In-Place Hold from the search. For details, see [Create or remove an In-Place Hold](create-or-remove-in-place-holds-exchange-2013-help.md).

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "In-Place eDiscovery" entry in the [Messaging Policy and Compliance Permissions](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ec4d3b9f-b85a-4cb9-95f5-6fc149c3899b.aspx) topic.
