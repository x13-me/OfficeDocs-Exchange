## Use the Shell to configure out-of-office replies

You can use the **Set-RemoteDomain** cmdlet to configure the properties of a remote domain.

This example disables out-of-office messages for the remote domain named Contoso.

```powershell
Set-RemoteDomain Contoso -AllowedOOFType None
```

This example allows only external out-of-office messages.

```powershell
Set-RemoteDomain Contoso -AllowedOOFType External
```
