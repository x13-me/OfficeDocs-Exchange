4.  Scroll down and click **More options**.

5.  Under **Connection limits**, use the following settings:
    
      - **Maximum connections**   Specifies the total number of connections the specified server will accept. This includes authenticated and unauthenticated connections. The default value is 2,147,483,647. The possible values are from 1 through 2,147,483,647.
    
      - **Maximum connections from a single IP address**   Specifies the number of connections that the server will accept from a single IP address. The default value is 2,147,483,647. The possible values are from 1 through 2,147,483,647.

This example sets the connection limit for a server.

```powershell
Set-PopSettings -Identity CAS01 -MaxConnections Value
```

This example sets the connection limit for an IP address.

```powershell
Set-PopSettings -Identity CAS01 -MaxConnectionsFromSingleIP Value

This example sets the connection limit for a user.

```powershell
    Set-PopSettings -MaxConnectionsPerUser Value 
```

This example sets the maximum command size.

```powershell
Set-PopSettings -MaxCommandSize Value
```

After you set connection limits, you must restart the POP3 services. For information about how to restart the POP3 services, see [Start and stop the POP3 services](start-and-stop-the-pop3-services-exchange-2013-help.md).
