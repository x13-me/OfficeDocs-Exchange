# Install or remove add-ins for Outlook for your Exchange 2013 organization

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You can install or remove add-ins for Outlook for your organization by using the EAC or the Exchange Management Shell. 

> [!NOTE]
> By default, after you install an add-in for your organization, the add-in is available for all users in your organization. After installation, you can use the EAC or the Exchange Management Shell to make the add-in optional or required for your users, and to specify whether you want the add-in to be enabled or disabled. For information about how to change the default settings for an add-in, see [Manage user access to add-ins for Outlook](manage-user-access-to-add-ins-2013-help.md). To limit availability of add-ins to specific users in your organization, you must use the Exchange Management Shell. For more information, see [Manage user access to add-ins for Outlook](manage-user-access-to-add-ins-2013-help.md). 

For additional management tasks, see [Add-ins for Outlook](add-ins-for-outlook-2013-help.md).
