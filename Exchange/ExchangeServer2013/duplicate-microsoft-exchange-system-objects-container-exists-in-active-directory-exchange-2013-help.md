# Duplicate Microsoft Exchange System Objects container exists in Active Directory

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Setup can't continue because it found a duplicate Microsoft Exchange System Objects container in Active Directory Domain Naming context. When Setup finds a duplicate Microsoft Exchange System Objects container, you must delete the duplicate container before Setup can continue. When a duplicate Microsoft Exchange System Objects container exists, you can't solve the problem by running **DomainPrep** again. You must identify and delete the duplicate Microsoft Exchange System Objects container.

To resolve this issue, do the following:

1. Log on to the domain controller with administrative credentials.

2. In **Administrative Tools**, click **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

3. In the **Active Directory Users and Computers** management console pane, click **View** from the toolbar menu and then select **Advanced Features**.

4. Locate the duplicate Microsoft Exchange System Objects container.

5. Verify the duplicate Microsoft Exchange System Objects container doesn't contain valid Active Directory objects.

6. Right-click the duplicate Microsoft Exchange System Objects container, and then click **Delete**.

7. Confirm the deletion by clicking **Yes** in the Active Directory dialog box.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want the change to be replicated immediately, you must manually initiate replication between domain controllers.
