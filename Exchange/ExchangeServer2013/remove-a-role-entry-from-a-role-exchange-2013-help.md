# Remove a role entry from a role

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


Management role entries on a management role determine what cmdlets and parameters are available on a management role. By removing role entries or parameters on a role entry, you can restrict what users assigned the management role can perform. For more information about management role entries in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, see [Understanding management roles](understanding-management-roles-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you want to do?

## Remove a single entire role entry from a role

When you remove a role entry from a role, you remove the ability for users assigned that role to access the associated cmdlet or script.

Use the following syntax to remove an entire management role entry from a role.

```powershell
Remove-ManagementRoleEntry <management role>\<management role entry>
```

This example removes the **Enable-MailUser** cmdlet from the Seattle Server Administrators role.

```powershell
Remove-ManagementRoleEntry "Seattle Server Administrators\Enable-MailUser"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Remove-ManagementRoleEntry](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd351187\(v=exchg.150\)).

## Remove multiple entire role entries from a role

When you remove multiple role entries from a role, you remove the ability for users assigned that role to access the associated cmdlets or scripts.

To remove multiple role entries from a role, you need to retrieve the list of role entries to remove using the **Get-ManagementRoleEntry** cmdlet. Then you need to pipe the output to the **Remove-ManagementRoleEntry** cmdlet. You can use wildcard characters with the **Get-ManagementRoleEntry** cmdlet to match multiple role entries. It's a good idea to use the *WhatIf* switch to verify that you're removing the correct role entries. Use the following syntax.

```powershell
    Get-ManagementRoleEntry <management role>\<role entry with wildcard character> | Remove-ManagementRoleEntry -WhatIf
```

This example removes all the role entries that contain the word journal from the Seattle Server Administrators role.

```powershell
    Get-ManagementRoleEntry "Seattle Server Administrators\*Journal*" | Remove-ManagementRoleEntry -WhatIf
```

When you run the command with the *WhatIf* switch, the cmdlet returns a list of all the role entries that would be removed. If the list looks correct, run the command again without the *WhatIf* switch to remove the role entries.

```powershell
    Get-ManagementRoleEntry "Seattle Server Administrators\*Journal*" | Remove-ManagementRoleEntry
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-ManagementRoleEntry](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335210\(v=exchg.150\)) and [Remove-ManagementRoleEntry](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd351187\(v=exchg.150\)).

## Remove parameters from a role entry on a role

When you remove parameters from a role entry on a role, those parameters are no longer available to users assigned the role.

Use the following syntax to remove parameters from a role entry.

```powershell
    Set-ManagementRoleEntry <management role>\<role entry> -Parameters <parameter 1>,<parameter 2...> -RemoveParameter
```

This example removes the *MaxSafeSenders*, *MaxSendSize*, *SecondaryAddress*, and *UseDatabaseQuotaDefaults* parameters from the **Set-Mailbox** role entry on the Seattle Server Administrators role.

```powershell
    Set-ManagementRoleEntry "Seattle Server Administrators\Set-Mailbox" -Parameters MaxSafeSenders,MaxSendSize,SecondaryAddress,UseDatabaseQuotaDefaults -RemoveParameter
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-ManagementRoleEntry](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd351162\(v=exchg.150\)).
