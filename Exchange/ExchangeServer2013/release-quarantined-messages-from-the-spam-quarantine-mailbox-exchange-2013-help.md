# Release quarantined messages from the spam quarantine mailbox

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


You can use Microsoft Outlook to recover a quarantined message from the spam quarantine mailbox.

Spam quarantine is a feature of the Content Filter agent that reduces the risk of losing legitimate messages. When a message meets the spam quarantine threshold, it's wrapped in a non-delivery report (NDR) and delivered to the spam quarantine mailbox. For more information about the spam quarantine feature, see [Spam quarantine](spam-quarantine-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

  - Estimated time to complete each procedure: 15 minutes

  - You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mailbox access" entry in the [Mail flow permissions](mail-flow-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

  - This procedure requires that you've configured the anti-spam quarantine mailbox. For more information, see [Configure a spam quarantine mailbox](configure-a-spam-quarantine-mailbox-exchange-2013-help.md).

  - To access the quarantine mailbox, you need to configure an Outlook profile for that mailbox and then open the mailbox using Outlook. For more information about configuring and using multiple Outlook profiles, see [Overview of Outlook e-mail profiles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=178975).

  - To make it easier to locate the message you want to recover, you can create a custom Outlook form and modify the default view to expose the original sender address in the list of messages. For detailed steps, see [Configure Outlook to show the original sender in the quarantine mailbox](configure-outlook-to-show-the-original-sender-in-the-quarantine-mailbox-exchange-2013-help.md).
