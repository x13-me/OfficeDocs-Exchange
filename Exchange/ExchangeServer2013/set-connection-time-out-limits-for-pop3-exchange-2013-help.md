## What do you want to do?

## Use the EAC to set connection time-out limits for POP3

2.  In the list of servers, select the Client Access server, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/JJ218640.6f53ccb2-1f13-4c02-bea0-30690e6ea71d(EXCHG.150).gif "Edit icon").

3.  On the server properties page, click **POP3**.

4.  Scroll down and click **More options**.

5.  Under **Time-out settings**, use the following settings:
    
      - **Authenticated time-out (seconds)**    Specifies the time to wait before closing an idle authenticated connection. The default value is 1,800. The possible values are from 30 through 86,400.
    
      - **Unauthenticated time-out (seconds)**   Specifies the time to wait before closing an idle connection that isn’t authenticated. The default value is 60. The possible values are from 30 through 3,600.

6.  Click **Apply**, and then click **OK** to save your changes.

After you've set the connection time-out limits for POP3, you must restart the POP3 services for the settings to take effect. For information about how to restart the POP3 services, see [Start and stop the POP3 services](start-and-stop-the-pop3-services-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to set connection time-out limits for POP3

This example sets the connection time-out limit for idle authenticated connections.

```powershell
Set -PopSettings -Identity CAS01 -AuthenticatedConnectionTimeout TimeValue
```

This example sets the connection time-out limit for idle unauthenticated connections.

```powershell
Set -PopSettings -Identity CAS01 -PreAuthenticatedConnectionTimeout TimeValue
```

After you've set the connection time-out limits for POP3, you must restart the POP3 services for the settings to take effect. For information about how to restart the POP3 services, see [Start and stop the POP3 services](start-and-stop-the-pop3-services-exchange-2013-help.md).
