Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the Microsoft Windows Server™ 2003 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service is installed on this computer.

Microsoft Exchange setup requires that the SMTP service not be installed on servers that are used for Exchange 2007.

To resolve this issue, uninstall the SMTP service and rerun Microsoft Exchange setup.

1. On the **Start** menu, click **Control Panel**.

2. Double-click **Add or Remove Programs**.

3. Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.

4. In the **Components** list, select the **Application Server** check box and then click **Details**.

5. Select **Internet Information Services Manager** and then click **Details**.

6. Select **SMTP Service** and then click to clear the check box.

7. Click **OK** two times to return to the **Components** list and then click **Next**.
