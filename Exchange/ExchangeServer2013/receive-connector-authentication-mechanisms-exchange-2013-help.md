<tr class="header">
<th>Authentication mechanism</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>None</p></td>
<td><p>No authentication.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>TLS</p></td>
<td><p>Advertise STARTTLS. Requires availability of a server certificate to offer TLS.</p></td>

<tr class="even">

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>BasicAuthRequireTLS</p></td>
<td><p>Basic authentication over TLS. Requires a server certificate.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>ExchangeServer</p></td>
<td><p>Exchange Server authentication (Generic Security Services application programming interface (GSSAPI) and Mutual GSSAPI).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>ExternalAuthoritative</p></td>
<td><p>The connection is considered externally secured by using a security mechanism that's external to Exchange. The connection may be an Internet Protocol security (IPsec) association or a virtual private network (VPN). Alternatively, the servers may reside in a trusted physically controlled network. The <code>ExternalAuthoritative</code> authentication method requires the <code>ExchangeServers</code> permission group. This combination of authentication method and security group permits the resolution of anonymous sender email addresses for messages that are received through this connector.</p></td>
