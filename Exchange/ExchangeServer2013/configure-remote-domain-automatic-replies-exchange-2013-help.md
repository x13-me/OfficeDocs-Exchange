You can use the Exchange Management Shell to configure the way emails are sent and received through remote domains. The following demonstrates how to use the Exchange Management Shell to configure the way Exchange handles automatic replies.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

  - Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes

  - You can only use the Shell to perform this procedure.

## Use the Shell to configure automatic replies

You can use the **Set-RemoteDomain** cmdlet to configure the properties of a remote domain.

This example allows automatic replies to the remote domain named Contoso. This setting is disabled by default.

```powershell
Set-RemoteDomain Contoso -AutoReplyEnabled $true
```

This example allows automatic forwards to the remote domain. This setting is disabled by default.

```powershell
Set-RemoteDomain Contoso -AutoForwardEnabled $true
```
