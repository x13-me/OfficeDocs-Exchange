# Exchange 2013 system requirements

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Learn about the Exchange 2013 requirements that you need to know before you install Exchange 2013. For example, you'll learn about the hardware, network, and operating system requirements.

Before you install Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, we recommend that you review this topic to ensure that your network, hardware, software, clients, and other elements meet the requirements for Exchange 2013. In addition, make sure you understand the coexistence scenarios that are supported for Exchange 2013 and earlier versions of Exchange.

## Supported coexistence scenarios

The following table lists the scenarios in which coexistence between Exchange 2013 and earlier versions of Exchange is supported.

### Coexistence of Exchange 2013 and earlier versions of Exchange Server

<br>

****

|Exchange version|Exchange organization coexistence|
|---|---|
|Exchange Server 2003 and earlier versions|Not supported|
|Exchange 2007|Supported with the following minimum versions of Exchange: <ul><li><p>Update Rollup 10 for Exchange 2007 Service Pack 3 (SP3) on all Exchange 2007 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers.<sup>1</sup></li><li>Exchange 2013 Cumulative Update 2 (CU2) or later on all Exchange 2013 servers in the organization.</li></ul>|
|Exchange 2010|Supported with the following minimum versions of Exchange: <ul><li><p>Exchange 2010 SP3 on all Exchange 2010 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers).<sup>2</sup></li><li>Exchange 2013 CU2 or later on all Exchange 2013 servers in the organization.</li></ul>|
|Mixed Exchange 2010 and Exchange 2007 organization|Supported with the following minimum versions of Exchange: <ul><li><p>Update Rollup 10 for Exchange 2007 SP3 on all Exchange 2007 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers.<sup>1</sup></li><li>Exchange 2010 SP3 on all Exchange 2010 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers.<sup>2</sup></li><li>Exchange 2013 CU2 or later on all Exchange 2013 servers in the organization.</li></ul>|
|

<sup>1</sup> If you want to create an EdgeSync Subscription between an Exchange 2007 Hub Transport server and an Exchange 2013 SP1 Edge Transport server, you need to install Exchange 2007 SP3 Update Rollup 13 or later on the Exchange 2007 Hub Transport server.

<sup>2</sup> If you want to create an EdgeSync Subscription between an Exchange 2010 Hub Transport server and an Exchange 2013 SP1 Edge Transport server, you need to install Exchange 2010 SP3 Update Rollup 5 or later on the Exchange 2010 Hub Transport server.

## Supported hybrid deployment scenarios

Exchange 2013 supports hybrid deployments with Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organizations that have been upgraded to the latest version of Microsoft 365 or Office 365. For more information about specific hybrid deployments, see [Hybrid deployment prerequisites](../ExchangeHybrid/hybrid-deployment-prerequisites.md).

## Network and directory servers

The following table lists the requirements for the network and the directory servers in your Exchange 2013 organization.

<br>

****

|Component|Requirement|
|---|---|
|Schema master|By default, the schema master runs on the first Active Directory domain controller installed in a forest. The schema master must be running one of the following: <ul><li>Windows Server 2016 Standard or Datacenter<sup>1</sup></li><li>Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard or Datacenter<sup>1</sup></li><li>Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard or Datacenter<sup>1</sup></li><li>Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter</li><li>Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard or Enterprise</li><li>Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter RTM or later</li><li>Windows Server 2008 Standard or Enterprise (32-bit or 64-bit)</li><li>Windows Server 2008 Datacenter RTM or later</li><li>Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition with Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later (32-bit or 64-bit)</li><li>Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition with SP2 or later (32-bit or 64-bit)</li></ul>|
|Global catalog server|In each Active Directory site where you plan to install Exchange 2013, you must have at least one global catalog server running one of the following: <ul><li>Windows Server 2016 Standard or Datacenter<sup>1</sup></li><li>Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard or Datacenter<sup>1</sup></li><li>Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter</li><li>Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard or Enterprise</li><li>Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter RTM or later</li><li>Windows Server 2008 Standard or Enterprise (32-bit or 64-bit)</li><li>Windows Server 2008 Datacenter RTM or later</li><li>Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition with Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later (32-bit or 64-bit)</li><li>Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition with SP2 or later (32-bit or 64-bit)</li></ul> <p> For more information about global catalog servers, see [What is the Global Catalog](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc728188(v=ws.10)).|
|Domain controller|In each Active Directory site where you plan to install Exchange 2013, you must have at least one writeable domain controller running one of the following: <ul><li>Windows Server 2016 Standard or Datacenter<sup>1</sup></li><li>Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard or Datacenter<sup>1</sup></li><li>Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter</li><li>Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard or Enterprise SP1 or later</li><li>Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter RTM or later</li><li>Windows Server 2008 Standard or Enterprise SP1 or later (32-bit or 64-bit)</li><li>Windows Server 2008 Datacenter RTM or later</li><li>Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition with Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later (32-bit or 64-bit)</li><li>Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition with SP2 or later (32-bit or 64-bit)</li></ul>|
|Active Directory forest|Active Directory must be at Windows Server 2003 forest functionality mode or higher.<sup>2</sup>|
|DNS namespace support|Exchange 2013 supports the following domain name system (DNS) namespaces: <ul><li>Contiguous</li><li>Noncontiguous</li><li>Single label domains</li><li>Disjoint</li></ul> <p> For more information about DNS namespaces supported by Exchange, see [KB2269838](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2269838).|
|IPv6 support|In Exchange 2013, IPv6 is supported only when IPv4 is also installed and enabled. If Exchange 2013 is deployed in this configuration, and the network supports IPv4 and IPv6, all Exchange servers can send data to and receive data from devices, servers, and clients that use IPv6 addresses. For more information, see [IPv6 support in Exchange 2013](ipv6-support-in-exchange-2013-exchange-2013-help.md).|
|

<sup>1</sup> Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 are supported only with Exchange 2013 SP1 or later.

<sup>2</sup> Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016 forest functionality mode is supported only with Exchange 2013 SP1 or later.

## Directory server architecture

The use of 64-bit Active Directory domain controllers increases directory service performance for Exchange 2013.

> [!NOTE]
> In multi-domain environments, on Windows Server 2008 domain controllers that have the Active Directory language locale set to Japanese, your servers might not receive some attributes that are stored on an object during inbound replication. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 949189, <A href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=1050">A Windows Server 2008 domain controller that is configured with the Japanese language locale may not apply updates to attributes on an object during inbound replication</A>.

## Installing Exchange 2013 on directory servers

For security and performance reasons, we recommend that you install Exchange 2013 only on member servers and not on Active Directory directory servers. However, you can't run DCPromo on a computer running Exchange 2013. After Exchange 2013 is installed, changing its role from a member server to a directory server, or vice versa, isn't supported.

## Hardware

The recommended hardware requirements for Exchange 2013 servers vary depending on a number of factors including the server roles that are installed and the anticipated load that will be placed on the servers.

For detailed information on how to properly size and configure your deployment, see [Exchange 2013 Sizing and Configuration Recommendations](exchange-2013-sizing-and-configuration-recommendations-exchange-2013-help.md).

For information about deploying Exchange in a virtualized environment, see [Exchange 2013 virtualization](exchange-2013-virtualization-exchange-2013-help.md).
