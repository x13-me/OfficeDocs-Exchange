These management roles are one of several built-in roles in the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions model in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013. Management roles, which are assigned to one or more management role groups, management role assignment policies, users, or universal security groups (USG), act as a logical grouping of cmdlets or scripts that are combined to provide access to view or modify the configuration of Exchange 2013 components, such as mailbox databases, transport rules, and recipients. If a cmdlet or script and its parameters, together called a management role entry, are included on a role, that cmdlet or script and its parameters can be run by those assigned the role. For more information about management roles and management role entries, see [Understanding management roles](understanding-management-roles-exchange-2013-help.md).

For more information about management roles, management role groups, and other RBAC components, see [Understanding Role Based Access Control](understanding-role-based-access-control-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Management role assignments

For these roles to grant permissions, it must be assigned to a role assignee, which can be a role group, user, or universal security group (USG). This assignment is done using management role assignments. Role assignments link role assignees and roles together. If more than one role is assigned to a role assignee, the role assignee is granted the combination of all the permissions granted by all the assigned roles.

In addition to linking role assignees to roles, role assignments can also apply custom or built-in management scopes. Management scopes control which recipient, server, and database objects can be modified by role assignees. If these roles are assigned to a role assignee, but a management scope allows the role assignee only to manage certain objects based on a defined scope, the role assignee can only use the permissions granted by these roles on those specific objects. The permissions provided by these roles can't be applied to objects outside the scope defined on the role assignment. For more information about role assignments and scopes, see the following topics:

  - [Understanding management role assignments](understanding-management-role-assignments-exchange-2013-help.md)

  - [Understanding management role scopes](understanding-management-role-scopes-exchange-2013-help.md)

These roles are assigned to one or more role groups by default. For more information, see the "Default Management Role Assignments" section later in this topic.

If you want to view a list of role groups, users, or USGs assigned to these roles, use the following command.

```powershell
Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -Role "<role name>"
```

## Regular and delegating role assignments

These roles can be assigned to role assignees using either regular or delegating role assignments. Regular role assignments grant the permissions provided by the role to the role assignee. Delegating role assignments grant the role assignee the ability to assign the role to other role assignees. For more information about regular and delegating role assignments, see [Understanding management role assignments](understanding-management-role-assignments-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Adding or removing role assignments

You can change which role assignees are assigned these roles. By changing which role assignee is assigned these roles, you change who is granted its permissions. You can assign these roles to other built-in role groups, or you can create role groups and assign these roles to them. You can also assign these roles to users or USGs. However, we recommend that you limit assignment of roles to users and USGs because such assignments can greatly increase the complexity of your permissions model.

To assign these roles to role assignees, the role must be assigned to a role group you're a member of, directly to you, or to a USG you're a member of, using a delegating role assignment. For more information about delegating role assignments, see the "Regular and Delegating Role Assignments" section.

You can also remove these roles from built-in role groups, role groups you create, users, and USGs. However, there must always be at least one delegating role assignment between these roles and a role group or USG. You can't delete the last delegating role assignment. This limitation helps prevent you from locking yourself out of the system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There must be at least one delegating role assignment between these roles and a role group or USG. You can't remove the last delegating role assignment associated with these roles if the last assignment is to a user.

For more information about how to add or remove assignments between these roles and role groups, users, and USGs, see the following topics:

  - [Manage role groups](manage-role-groups-exchange-2013-help.md)

  - [Add a role to a user or USG](add-a-role-to-a-user-or-usg-exchange-2013-help.md)

  - [Remove a role from a user or USG](remove-a-role-from-a-user-or-usg-exchange-2013-help.md)

## Changing the management scopes on role assignments

You can also change the management scopes on existing role assignments between these roles and role assignees. By changing the scopes on role assignments, you control what objects can be managed using the permissions provided by these roles. You have several choices when changing the scope on a role assignment. You can do one of the following:

  - Add a new custom scope using the **Set-ManagementRoleAssignment** cmdlet. For more information, see the following topics:

      - [Create a regular or exclusive scope](create-a-regular-or-exclusive-scope-exchange-2013-help.md)

      - [Change a role assignment](change-a-role-assignment-exchange-2013-help.md)

  - Add or change an organizational unit scope using the **Set-ManagementRoleAssignment** cmdlet. For more information, see [Change a role assignment](change-a-role-assignment-exchange-2013-help.md).

  - Add or change a predefined scope using the **Set-ManagementRoleAssignment** cmdlet. For more information, see [Change a role assignment](change-a-role-assignment-exchange-2013-help.md).

  - Change the recipient, server, or database scope on a custom scope associated with a role assignment using the **Set-ManagementScope** cmdlet. For more information, see [Change a role scope](change-a-role-scope-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Enabling or disabling role assignments

By enabling or disabling a role assignment, you control whether that role assignment should be in effect. If a role assignment is disabled, the permissions granted by the associated role aren't applied to the role assignee. This is convenient if you want to temporarily remove permissions without deleting a role assignment. For more information, see [Change a role assignment](change-a-role-assignment-exchange-2013-help.md).


## Management role customization

These roles have been configured to provide a role assignee with all necessary cmdlets and parameters to manage the features and components listed at the beginning of this topic. Other roles have also been provided to enable management of other features. By adding and removing roles to and from role groups, you can create a customized permissions model without the need to customize individual management roles. For a complete list of roles, see [Built-in management roles](built-in-management-roles-exchange-2013-help.md). For more information about customizing role groups, see [Manage role groups](manage-role-groups-exchange-2013-help.md).

If you decide that you need to create a customized version of these roles, you must create a role as a child of these roles, and customize the new role.

> [!WARNING]
> The following information enables you to perform advanced management of permissions. Customizing management roles can significantly increase the complexity of your permissions model. You could cause certain features to stop functioning if you replace a built-in management role with an incorrectly configured custom role.

The following are the most common steps to create a customized role and assign it to a role assignee:

1. Create a copy of a role. For more information, see [Create a role](create-a-role-exchange-2013-help.md).

2. Change or remove the role entries on the new role using the **Set-ManagementRoleEntry** and **Remove-ManagementRoleEntry** cmdlets. You can't add additional role entries to the new role because it can only contain the role entries on the parent built-in role. For more information, see the following topics:

      - [Change a role entry](change-a-role-entry-exchange-2013-help.md)

      - [Remove a role entry from a role](remove-a-role-entry-from-a-role-exchange-2013-help.md)

3. If you want to replace the built-in role with this new customized role, remove any role assignments associated with the built-in role. For more information, see the following topics:

      - "Add or remove a role to or from a role group" section in [Manage role groups](manage-role-groups-exchange-2013-help.md)

      - [Remove a role from a user or USG](remove-a-role-from-a-user-or-usg-exchange-2013-help.md)

4. Add the new customized role to the required role assignees. For more information, see the following topics:

      - "Add or remove a role to or from a role group" section in [Manage role groups](manage-role-groups-exchange-2013-help.md)

      - [Add a role to a user or USG](add-a-role-to-a-user-or-usg-exchange-2013-help.md)

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > If you want other users, in addition to the user that created the role, to be able to assign the new customized role, be sure to add a delegating role assignment to at least one role assignee. For more information, see [Delegate role assignments](delegate-role-assignments-exchange-2013-help.md).
