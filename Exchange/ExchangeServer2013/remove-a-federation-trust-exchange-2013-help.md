# Remove a federation trust

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


A federation trust establishes a trust relationship between a Microsoft Exchange 2013 organization and the Azure Active Directory authentication system and supports sharing with other federated Exchange organizations. Removing a federation trust from your on-premises Exchange organization will disable federated sharing with other federated Exchange organizations and with Office 365 organizations connected to your organization as part of a hybrid deployment. You should carefully consider the overall impact to your organization before removing a federation trust.

For additional management tasks related to federation trusts, see [Federation procedures](federation-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you want to do?

## Use the EAC to remove a federation trust

1.  On an Exchange 2013 server in your on-premises organization, navigate to **organization** \> **sharing**.

2.  In the **Federation Trust** section, click **Remove**.

3.  In the warning, click **yes** to confirm that you want to remove the federation trust.

4.  After the federation trust is removed, click **Close**.

## Use the Shell to remove a federation trust

This example removes the federation trust.

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have successfully removed the federation trust, do one of the following:

  - In the EAC, navigate to **organization** \> **sharing**. If you successfully removed the federation trust, only the **Enable** button will be available under **Federation Trust**.

  - In the Shell, run the following command to verify that federation trust information isn’t returned for your Exchange organization.
    
    ```powershell
    Get-FederationTrust
    ```
