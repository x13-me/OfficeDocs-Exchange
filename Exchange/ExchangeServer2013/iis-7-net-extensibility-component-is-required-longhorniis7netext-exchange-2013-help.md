Microsoft® Exchange Server 2010 Setup cannot continue because the required Internet Information Server (IIS) 7 .NET Extensibility component is not installed on the target server.

Before Exchange 2010 can use Windows PowerShell Remoting, the IIS 7 .NET Extensibility component must be installed on the target server.

To address this error, use Server Manager to install the IIS 7 .NET Extensibility component on this server and then rerun Exchange 2010 setup.

**Install the IIS 7 .NET Extensibility component in Windows Server 2008 or in Windows Server 2008 R2 by using the Server Manager tool**

1. Click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools** and then **Server Manager**.

2. In the left navigation pane, expand **Roles**, and then right-click **Web Server (IIS)** and select **Add Role Services**.

3. On the **Select Role Services** pane, scroll down to **Application Development**.

4. Select the check box under **.NET Extensibility**.

5. Click **Next** from the **Select Role Services** pane, and then click **Install** at the **Confirm Installations Selections** pane.

6. Click **Close** to exit the Add Role Services wizard.
