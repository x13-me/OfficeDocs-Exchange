# Anti-malware protection

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


The Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 anti-malware protection feature helps combat malware in your email messaging environment. *Malware* is comprised of viruses and spyware. *Viruses* infect other programs and data, and they spread throughout your computer looking for programs to infect. *Spyware* refers to malware that gathers your personal information, such as sign-in information and personal data, and sends it back to its author.

There are several anti-malware protection options in Exchange 2013:

  - **Built-in anti-malware protection in Exchange 2013**   You can use the built-in Exchange on-premises anti-malware protection feature in order to help you combat malware. This basic anti-malware protection can be turned off, replaced, or paired with a cloud-based service (such as Microsoft Exchange Online Protection or Microsoft Forefront Online Protection for Exchange) to provide a layered defense. For more information about typical questions and answers regarding the product’s built-in anti-malware capabilities, see [Anti-malware FAQ](anti-malware-faq-exchange-2013-help.md). For information about configuring your anti-malware policies so that they are tailored to best meet the needs of your organization, see [Configure anti-malware policies](configure-anti-malware-policies-exchange-2013-help.md).

  - **Cloud-hosted anti-malware protection**   The service leverages partnerships with several best of breed anti-malware engines, thereby providing efficient, cost effective, multi-layered anti-malware protection. EOP anti-malware protection features are included in Microsoft Exchange Online. For more information about these features, see [Anti-malware protection](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200669\(v=exchg.150\)).

  - **Third-party anti-malware protection**   You can also use a third-party anti-malware protection program. In this case, you may want to disable the built-in anti-malware protection; for more information, see [Disable or bypass anti-malware scanning](disable-or-bypass-anti-malware-scanning-exchange-2013-help.md).
