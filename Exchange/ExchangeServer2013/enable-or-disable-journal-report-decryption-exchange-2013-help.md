# Enable or Disable Journal Report Decryption

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


Enabling journal report decryption allows the Journaling agent to attach a decrypted copy of a rights-protected message to the journal report. Before you enable journal report decryption, you must add the Federated Delivery mailbox to the super users group configured on your [Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831364.aspx) server.

For additional management tasks related to Information Rights Management (IRM), see [Information Rights Management procedures](information-rights-management-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

  - Estimated time to complete: 1 minute

  - You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Rights protection" entry in the [Messaging policy and compliance permissions](messaging-policy-and-compliance-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

  - Members of the super users group are granted an owner use license when they request a license from the AD RMS cluster. This allows them to decrypt all RMS-protected content created by that AD RMS cluster.

  - An AD RMS cluster must be installed in the Active Directory forest.

  - The Federated Delivery mailbox has been added to an AD RMS super users group. For details, see [Add the Federation Mailbox to the AD RMS Super Users Group](add-the-federation-mailbox-to-the-ad-rms-super-users-group-exchange-2013-help.md).

  - You can't use the Exchange Administration Center (EAC) to enable journal report decryption. You must use the Shell.

  - For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).
