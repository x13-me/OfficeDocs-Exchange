# Update a global address list

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


You can use the Shell to update a global address list (GAL). A GAL is a directory that contains entries for every group, user, and contact within an organization's implementation of Microsoft Exchange.

For additional management tasks related to address lists, see [Address list procedures](address-list-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

  - Estimated time to complete each procedure: 5 minutes.

  - You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address lists" entry in the [Email address and address book permissions](email-address-and-address-book-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

  - By default in Exchange Online, the Address List role isn’t assigned to any role groups. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in the topic, [Manage role groups](manage-role-groups-exchange-2013-help.md).

  - You can’t use the Exchange Administration Center (EAC) to perform this procedure. You must use the Shell.

  - For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).
