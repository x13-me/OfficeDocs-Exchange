Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because its attempt to install the Mailbox Server or Client Access role found that the World Wide Web Publishing Service is either disabled or not installed on this computer.

Exchange 2007 setup requires the computer that you are installing Microsoft Exchange to have the World Wide Web Publishing Service installed and set to something other than disabled.

To resolve this issue, verify that the World Wide Web Publishing service is installed and not disabled on the local computer, and then rerun Microsoft Exchange setup.
