# Configure the startup mode on a Mailbox server

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


You can specify the startup mode for the Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging service on a Mailbox server. By default, the Mailbox server will start up in TCP mode, but if you’re using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic, you must configure the Mailbox server to use TLS or Dual mode. We recommend that Mailbox servers be configured to use Dual as the startup mode. This is because all Client Access servers and Mailbox servers can answer incoming calls for all UM dial plans, and those dial plans can have different security settings (Unsecured, SIP secured, or Secured). If you change the startup mode, you must restart the Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging service for the change to take effect.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, Mailbox servers are available to answer incoming calls. You don’t have to add a Mailbox server to a UM dial plan to process UM calls unless you’re integrating UM and Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 or Microsoft Lync Server.



For additional management tasks related to Unified Messaging and Mailbox servers, see [UM services procedures](um-services-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

  - Estimated time to complete: Less than 1 minute.

  - You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mailbox server (UM service)" entry in the [Unified Messaging permissions](unified-messaging-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

  - Verify that the Mailbox server is installed, either on the same computer as the Client Access server or on a separate computer.

## What do you want to do?

## Use the EAC to configure the startup mode on a Mailbox server

1.  In the EAC, navigate to **Servers** \> **Servers**.

2.  In the list view, select the Exchange server you want to modify, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/JJ218640.6f53ccb2-1f13-4c02-bea0-30690e6ea71d(EXCHG.150).gif "Edit icon").

3.  On the **Exchange Server** page, click **Unified Messaging**.

4.  Under **UM Service settings** \> **UM startup mode**, select one of the following from the drop-down list:
    
      - **TCP**   Use this option if you aren’t using mTLS and are using only Unsecured dial plans.
    
      - **TLS**   Use this option if you are using mTLS and using only SIP Secured or Secured dial plans.
    
      - **DUAL**   Use this option if you are using mTLS and using Unsecured, SIP Secured, and Secured dial plans.

5.  After you select the UM startup mode, click **Save**.

## Use the Shell to configure the startup mode on a Mailbox server

This example sets the startup mode for a Mailbox server named `MyUMServer1` to Dual mode.

```powershell
Set-UMService -Identity MyUMServer1 -UMStartUpMode Dual
```

This example sets the startup mode for a Mailbox server named `MyUMServer1` to TLS mode.

```powershell
Set-UMService -Identity MyUMServer1 -UMStartUpMode TLS
```
