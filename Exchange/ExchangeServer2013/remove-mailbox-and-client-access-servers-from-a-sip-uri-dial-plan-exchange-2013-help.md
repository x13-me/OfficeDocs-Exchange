# Remove Mailbox and Client Access servers from a SIP URI dial plan

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


You can remove Client Access and Mailbox servers from SIP URI dial plans. When you’re deploying Microsoft Lync Server, to enable outbound calling to work correctly, you must manually add all Client Access and Mailbox servers to the SIP URI dial plans that you’ve created for Lync Server. However, you may need to remove a Client Access or Mailbox server from your Lync deployment, for example, if you’re performing maintenance or taking the server offline.

For additional management tasks related to UM dial plans, see [UM dial plan procedures](um-dial-plan-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you want to do?

## Use the EAC to remove a Mailbox server from a SIP URI dial plan

1.  In the EAC, navigate to **Servers** \> **Servers**.

2.  In the list view, select the Mailbox server you want to modify, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/JJ218640.6f53ccb2-1f13-4c02-bea0-30690e6ea71d(EXCHG.150).gif "Edit icon").

3.  On the **Exchange Server** page, click **Unified Messaging**.

4.  Under **UM Service settings** \> **Associated dial plans**, locate the SIP URI dial plan to remove, click **Remove** ![Remove icon](images/Dd362328.479b6ced-8d64-4277-a725-f17fea202b28(EXCHG.150).gif "Remove icon"), and then click **Save**. If you want to remove more than one SIP URI dial plan, press and hold the CTRL key, select the dial plans you want to remove, and then click **Save**.

## Use the Shell to remove a Mailbox server from a SIP URI dial plan

This example removes the Mailbox server named `MyMailboxServer` from a SIP URI dial plan named `MySIPDialPlan`.

```powershell
    $dp= Get-UMDialPlan "MySIPDialPlan"
    $s=Get-UMService MyMailboxServer
    $s.dialplans-=$dp.identity
    Set-UMService -id MyMailboxServer -dialplans:$s.dialplans
```

In this example, there are three SIP URI dial plans: SipDP1, SipDP2 and SipDP3. This example removes the Mailbox server named `MyMailboxServer` from the SipDP3 dial plan.

```powershell
Set-UMService -id MyMailboxServer -DialPlans SipDP1,SipDP2
```

In this example, there are two SIP URI dial plans: SipDP1 and SipDP2. This example removes the Mailbox server named `MyMailboxServer` from the SipDP2 dial plan.

```powershell
Set-UMService -id MyMailboxServer -DialPlans SipDP1
```

This example removes the Mailbox server named `MyMailboxServer` from all SIP dial plans.

```powershell
Set-UMService -id MyUMServer -DialPlans $null
```
