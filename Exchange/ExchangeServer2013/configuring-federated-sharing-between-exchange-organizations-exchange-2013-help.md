# Configuring federated sharing between Exchange organizations

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


With federated sharing, users in your on-premises Exchange organization can share free/busy calendar information with recipients in other Exchange organizations that are also configured for federated sharing. Free/busy sharing can be enabled between two organizations running Exchange 2013 and also between organizations with a mixed Exchange deployment. To learn more about federated sharing, see [Sharing](sharing-exchange-2013-help.md).

This topic provides a summary of the requirements and configuration steps necessary to enable free/busy sharing between different types of the following common Exchange deployments:

  - Two Exchange 2013 organizations.

  - An Exchange 2013 organization and an Exchange 2010 SP2 organization.

  - An Exchange 2007 organization (or mixed Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 SP2 organization) and an Exchange 2013 organization.

  - An Exchange 2003 organization (or mixed Exchange 2003 and Exchange 2010 SP2 organization) and an Exchange 2013 organization.

For additional management tasks related to federated sharing, see [Federation procedures](federation-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

  - Complete the following steps in the Exchange 2007 organization:
    
    1.  **Add an Exchange 2010 SP2 server**
        
        An Exchange 2010 SP2 server with the Client Access server role must be installed in the Exchange 2007 organization. If you have existing Exchange 2010 servers, they should also be updated to Exchange 2010 SP2. For information about installing Exchange 2010 in an Exchange 2007 organization, see [Exchange 2007 - Planning Roadmap for Upgrade and Coexistence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=268411).
    
    2.  **Configure federated delegation**
        
        Configure federated delegation for the Exchange 2007 organization. On an Exchange 2010 SP2 server in the Exchange 2007 organization, complete the steps in [Configure federated delegation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=268410).
    
    3.  **Configure Active Directory synchronization**
        
        Active Directory synchronization must be configured for all users that need to share free/busy information between the organizations. You can either configure the Active Directory synchronization manually or use an automated Active Directory synchronization service. To configure Active Directory synchronization, see the steps below:
        
          - **Prerequisites**   Make sure your organization meets the requirements for installing Active Directory synchronization.
            
            To learn more, see [Prepare for Active Directory Synchronization](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=247302)
        
          - **Plan**   Understand the Microsoft Online Services Directory Synchronization tool and installation roadmap.
            
            To learn more, see [Active Directory Synchronization: Roadmap](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=203007)
        
          - **Install and Configure**   Configure Active Directory synchronization between your on-premises organization and the Office 365 tenant service organization.
            
            To learn more, see [Install and Upgrade the Microsoft Online Services Directory Synchronization tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=247303)
    
    4.  **Create an availability address space**
        
        Create an availability address space for the remote Exchange 2013 organization that directs availability requests from Exchange 2007 mailbox users to the Exchange 2010 SP2 Client Access server in the Exchange 2007 organization. This setting enables user availability requests from Exchange 2007 users for users in the remote Exchange 2013 organization to be proxied through the Exchange 2010 Client Access server in the Exchange 2007 organization. The Exchange 2010 Client Access server in the Exchange 2007 organization uses the federation trust and organization relationship to send the availability requests to the remote Exchange 2013 organization forest availability endpoint.
        
        To configure the availability address space, on the Exchange 2010 Client Access server in the Exchange 2007 organization, run the following command in the Exchange Management Shell:
        
        ```powershell
            Add-AvailabilityAddressSpace -AccessMethod InternalProxy -ProxyUrl https://<Exchange 2010 CAS server name>/ews/exchange.asmx -ForestName <SMTP domain of the remote Exchange organization> -UseServiceAccount $True
        ```
        
        For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Add-AvailabilityAddressSpace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=268413)

For information about installing Exchange 2010 in an Exchange 2003 organization, see [Exchange 2003 - Planning Roadmap for Upgrade and Coexistence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=268414).
        

        > [!WARNING]
        > For free/busy sharing to work properly between Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2003 organizations, the <STRONG>OU=EXTERNAL (FYDIBOHF25SPDLT)</STRONG> public folder must exist in the public folder hierarchy. This folder is automatically created on the Exchange 2010 Mailbox server in the Exchange 2003 organization only if you select the option to create public folders as part of configuring client settings for Outlook 2003 support during Exchange 2010 Setup. Additionally, this option is presented during the setup process only if the Exchange 2010 Mailbox server is the first Mailbox server installed in the organization. If the <STRONG>OU=EXTERNAL (FYDIBOHF25SPDLT)</STRONG> public folder wasn’t created during Setup, you must manually create it. For details about how to create this public folder, see <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052&kbid=2555008">How to troubleshoot Free/Busy issues when you use Exchange Federation in the Microsoft Office 365 for enterprises environment</A>.

          - Click **OK** to close **OU=EXTERNAL (FYDIBOHF25SPDLT) Properties** and save your changes.
        
          - Complete the same steps above for the **OU=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)** folder.
            

            > [!WARNING]
            > Depending on the size of your public folders, this replication could take several hours to complete.

        
          - After the **OU=EXTERNAL (FYDIBOHF25SPDLT)** and **OU=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)** public folders have replicated to the Exchange 2010 Client Access/Mailbox server, you must remove the replicas for these public folders on the Exchange 2003 server.
    
    5.  **Modify the LegacyExchangeDN parameter**
        
        Modify the *LegacyExchangeDN* parameter on all mail-enabled objects in the Exchange 2003 organization that reference the remote Exchange 2013 organization. Change the existing organizational unit (OU) value for the mail-enabled object to **External (FYDIBOHF25SPDLT)**. For example, **LegacyExchangeDN=/o=First Organization/ou=External (FYDIBOHF25SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=User Name**.
        
        To modify mail-enabled objects in the Exchange 2003 organization, you can use either the [Active Directory Service Interfaces Editor (ADSI Edit) tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=294644) or the [Microsoft Exchange Server LegacyDN Utility](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=294643).
