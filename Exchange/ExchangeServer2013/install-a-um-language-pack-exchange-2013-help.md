# Install a UM language pack

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


To make a language available in the list of available Unified Messaging languages on a UM dial plan or UM auto attendant, you must first install the appropriate UM language pack. You install the language pack on a Mailbox server running the Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging service by using the language-specific self-extracting executable file or the **setup.exe /AddUmLanguagePack** command. Before you can install a UM language pack, you must first download it to a local folder on the Mailbox server. You can download UM language packs from [Exchange Server 2013 UM Language Packs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=266542). There’s a separate executable file for each language.

After you install the appropriate UM language pack, you can view the list of installed UM language packs by viewing the drop-down list on the **Settings** page of a UM dial plan or the **Language for automated voice interface** drop-down list on the **General** page of a UM auto attendant. You can also configure the default language to be a language other than English (en-US) on UM dial plans and auto attendants.


> [!WARNING]
> The UM language packs for Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 or Exchange 2007 Service Pack&nbsp;1&nbsp;(SP1), SP2, or SP3 or Exchange 2010 Service Pack&nbsp;1&nbsp;SP1, SP2, or SP3 can't be used on an Exchange 2013 Mailbox server.

## What do you want to do?

## Use the UM Language Pack Installation (.exe) file to install a UM language pack

1.  From the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=266542), download the language-specific UM language pack (.exe) file into a local folder on the Mailbox server.

2.  Double-click the UMLanguagePack.*\<CultureCode\>.exe* file. For example, for the German UM language pack, you would download the file named UMLanguagePack.de-DE.exe.

3.  In the Exchange 2013 Setup wizard, on the **License Agreement** page, read the terms of the agreement, select **I accept the terms in the license agreement**, and then click **Next**.

4.  On the **Unified Messaging Language Pack** page, verify that the correct language is listed in the **The following Unified Messaging Language Pack(s) will be installed** window, and then click **Install**.

5.  Click **Finish** to complete the installation of the UM language pack.

## Use setup.exe to install a UM language pack

This example installs the Japanese (ja-JP) UM language pack that's been downloaded to the D:\\Exchange\\UMLanguagePacks folder on a Mailbox server.

```powershell
setup.exe /AddUmLanguagePack:ja-JP /s:d:\Exchange\UMLanguagePacks /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms
```

This example installs the Mexican Spanish (es-MX) and German (de-DE) UM language packs that have been downloaded to the D:\\Exchange\\UMLanguagePacks folder on a Mailbox server.

```powershell
    setup.exe /AddUmLanguagePack:es-MX,de-DE /s:d:\Exchange\UMLanguagePacks /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you don’t use the /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms parameter, you’ll see the following error: Welcome to Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Unattended Setup. You need to accept the license terms to install Microsoft Exchange Server 2013. To read the license agreement, visit http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=150127. To accept the license agreement, add the /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms parameter to the command you're running. For more information, run setup /?.
