Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 setup displays this warning because an existing Hub Transport server role could not be detected in the local Active Directory® directory service site.

You have chosen to install the Mailbox Server role before an instance of the Hub Transport role is installed in the Active Directory site.

Exchange 2007 Hub Transport Services are deployed inside your organization's Active Directory. Hub Transport Services handle all mail flow inside the organization, applies organizational mail flow routing rules, and are responsible for delivering messages to a recipient's mailbox.

Users will be able to log on to their mailboxes, but mail cannot be sent or received from this mailbox server until a Hub Transport role is installed.
