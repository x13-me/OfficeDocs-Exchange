# Remove a role from a user or USG

## Remove a management role assignment

If you know the name of the role assignment you want to remove, use the following syntax.

```powershell
Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment <assignment name>
```

For example, to remove the "Tier 2 Help Desk Assignment" role assignment, use the following command.

```powershell
Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment "Tier 2 Help Desk Assignment"
```

If you don't know the name of the role assignment, you can use the following syntax.

```powershell
    Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -RoleAssignee <user or USG> -Role <role name> -Delegating <$true | $false> | Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment 
```

For example, if you want to remove the Mail Recipients regular role assignment from the user davids, use the following command.

```powershell
    Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -RoleAssignee davids -Role "Mail Recipients" -Delegating $false | Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment
```
