# Change a role scope

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


Management role scopes determine what objects are made available to a user so that the objects can be changed using the cmdlets and parameters assigned to them. By changing a scope, you can change what objects are made available to users to create, change, or remove.

You can change a custom management scope. You can change either exclusive or regular scopes. If you change an exclusive scope, the new scope takes effect immediately. If you want to change a management role assignment with a predefined or organizational unit (OU) management scope, see [Change a role assignment](change-a-role-assignment-exchange-2013-help.md).

For more information about management role scopes and assignments in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, see the following topics:

  - [Understanding management role scopes](understanding-management-role-scopes-exchange-2013-help.md)

  - [Understanding management role assignments](understanding-management-role-assignments-exchange-2013-help.md)

## What do you want to do?

## Change the name of a scope

To change the name of a scope, use the following syntax.

```powershell
Set-ManagementScope <current scope name> -Name <new scope name>
```

This example changes the Seattle Servers scope to Seattle Exchange Servers.

```powershell
Set-ManagementScope "Seattle Servers" -Name "Seattle Exchange Servers"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-ManagementScope](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd297996\(v=exchg.150\)).

## Change a recipient filter on a scope

To change the recipient filter on a scope, use the following syntax.

```powershell
Set-ManagementScope <scope name> -RecipientRestrictionFilter { <new recipient filter> }
```

This example changes the recipient filter to match all the recipient objects where the **Company** property is set to contoso.

```powershell
Set-ManagementScope "Company Scope" -RecipientRestrictionFilter { Company -eq 'contoso' }
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-ManagementScope](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd297996\(v=exchg.150\)).

For more information about recipient filters and to see a list of filterable recipient properties, see [Understanding management role scope filters](understanding-management-role-scope-filters-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Change the organizational unit root on a scope

To change the OU root on a scope, use the following syntax.

```powershell
Set-ManagementScope <scope name> -RecipientRoot <OU>
```

This example changes the OU root to the North America/Sales Sales Users OU under the contoso.com domain.

```powershell
Set-ManagementScope "Sales Users" -RecipientRoot "contoso.com/North America/Sales"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-ManagementScope](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd297996\(v=exchg.150\)).

## Change a server filter on a scope

To change the server filter on a scope, use the following syntax.

```powershell
Set-ManagementScope <scope name> -ServerRestrictionFilter { <new server filter> }
```

This example changes the server filter to match all the server objects where the **ServerSite** property is set to 'CN=Redmond,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=com'.

```powershell
    Set-ManagementScope "Company Scope" -ServerRestrictionFilter { ServerSite -eq 'CN=Redmond,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=com' }
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-ManagementScope](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd297996\(v=exchg.150\)).

For more information about server filters and to see a list of filterable server properties, see [Understanding management role scope filters](understanding-management-role-scope-filters-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Change the server list on a scope

You can't change the list of servers on a scope. If you need to change the server list, you need to do the following:

1.  If needed, retrieve the current server list in the scope to be replaced by using the "View a specific scope" procedure in the [View role scopes](view-role-scopes-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

2.  Create a scope with the new server list by using the "Step 1: Create a custom scope" procedure in the [Create a regular or exclusive scope](create-a-regular-or-exclusive-scope-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

3.  Change all the management role assignments that use the old scope to use the new scope by using the "Use the Shell to change the server filter or list-based scope on a role assignment" procedure in the [Change a role assignment](change-a-role-assignment-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

4.  Remove the old scope by using the procedure in the [Remove a role scope](remove-a-role-scope-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

## Change a database filter on a scope

To change the database filter on a scope, use the following syntax.

```powershell
Set-ManagementScope <scope name> -DatabaseRestrictionFilter { <new database filter> }
```

This example changes the database filter to match all the database objects where the **Name** property contains the string "Executive".

```powershell
    Set-ManagementScope "Database Executive Scope" -DatabaseRestrictionFilter { Name -Like "*Executive*" }
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-ManagementScope](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd297996\(v=exchg.150\)).

For more information about database filters and to see a list of filterable database properties, see [Understanding management role scope filters](understanding-management-role-scope-filters-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Change the database list on a scope

You can't change the list of databases on a scope. If you need to change the database list, you need to do the following:

1.  If needed, retrieve the current database list in the scope to be replaced by using the "View a specific scope" procedure in the [View role scopes](view-role-scopes-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

2.  Create a scope with the new database list by using the "Step 1: Create a custom scope" procedure in the [Create a regular or exclusive scope](create-a-regular-or-exclusive-scope-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

3.  Change all the management role assignments that use the old scope to use the new scope by using the "Use the Shell to change the database filter or list-based scope on a role assignment" procedure in the [Change a role assignment](change-a-role-assignment-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

4.  Remove the old scope by using the procedure in the [Remove a role scope](remove-a-role-scope-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.
