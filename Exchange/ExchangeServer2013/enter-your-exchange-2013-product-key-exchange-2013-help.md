# Enter your Exchange 2013 product key

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


A product key tells Exchange Server 2013 that you've purchased a Standard or Enterprise Edition license. If the product key you purchased is for an Enterprise Edition license, it lets you mount more than five databases per server in addition to everything that's available with a Standard Edition license. If you want to read more about Exchange licensing, see [Exchange 2013: editions and versions](exchange-2013-editions-and-versions-exchange-2013-help.md).

If you don't enter a product key, your server is automatically licensed as a trial edition. The trial edition functions just like an Exchange Standard Edition server and is helpful if you want to try out Exchange before you buy it, or to run tests in a lab. The only difference is that you can only use an Exchange server licensed as a trial edition for up to 180 days. If you want to keep using the server beyond 180 days, you'll need to enter a product key or the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) will start to show reminders that you need to enter a product key to license the server.

## What do you want to do?

## Use the EAC to enter the product key

1.  Open the EAC by browsing to https://\<*Client Access server name*\>/ecp.

2.  Enter your user name and password in **Domain\\user name** and **Password**, and then click **Sign in**.

3.  Go to **Servers** \> **Servers**. Select the server you want to license, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/JJ218640.6f53ccb2-1f13-4c02-bea0-30690e6ea71d(EXCHG.150).gif "Edit icon").

4.  (Optional) If you want to upgrade the server from a Standard Edition license to an Enterprise Edition license, on the **General** page, select **Change product key**. You'll only see this option if the server is already licensed.

5.  On the **General** page, enter your product key in the **Enter a valid product key** text boxes.

6.  Click **Save**.

7.  If you licensed an Exchange server running the Mailbox server role, do the following to restart the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service:
    
    1.  Open **Control Panel**, go to **Administrative Tools**, and then open **Services**.
    
    2.  Right-click on **Microsoft Exchange Information Store** and click **Restart**.

## Use the Shell to enter the product key

This example uses the **set-ExchangeServer** cmdlet to enter the product key.


> [!NOTE]
> You can run this command again on the same server to upgrade it from a Standard Edition license to an Enterprise Edition license.



```powershell
Set-ExchangeServer ExServer01 -ProductKey aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-ExchangeServer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123716\(v=exchg.150\)).

If you licensed an Exchange server running the Mailbox server role, do the following to restart the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service:

1.  Open **Control Panel**, go to **Administrative Tools**, and then open **Services**.

2.  Right-click **Microsoft Exchange Information Store** and click **Restart**.

## How do you know this worked?

To use the EAC to verify that you’ve successfully licensed the server as Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition, do the following:

1.  Enter your user name and password in **Domain\\user name** and **Password**, and then click **Sign in**.

2.  Go to **Servers** \> **Servers**.

3.  Select the server you want to view, and then look in the server details pane. If the product key has been accepted, **Licensed** will appear along with the Exchange 2013 edition.

To use the Shell to verify that you’ve successfully licensed the server as Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition, do the following:

1.  Open the Shell.

2.  Run the following command to view the licensing status of a specific Exchange server.
    
    ```powershell
        Get-ExchangeServer ExServer01 | Format-Table Edition,*Trial*
    ```
3.  (Optional) Run the following command to view the licensing status of all Exchange servers in your organization.
    
    ```powershell
        Get-ExchangeServer | Format-Table Name, Edition, *Trial* -Auto
    ```
