# Search the mailbox audit log for a mailbox

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


You can synchronously search mailbox audit log entries for a mailbox and have the search results displayed in the Shell.

If you want to search mailbox audit logs for multiple mailboxes and have the results emailed to a specified address, you must create a mailbox audit log search instead. For details, see [Create a mailbox audit log search](create-a-mailbox-audit-log-search-exchange-2013-help.md).

For additional management tasks related to mailbox audit logging, see [Mailbox audit logging procedures](mailbox-audit-logging-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
