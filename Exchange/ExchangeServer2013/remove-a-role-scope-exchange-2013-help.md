# Remove a role scope

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


Management role scopes determine what objects are made available to a user who can then change the objects using the cmdlets and parameters assigned to the user. If you're no longer using a scope, it can be removed. For more information about management role scopes in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, see [Understanding management role scopes](understanding-management-role-scopes-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

  - Estimated time to complete each procedure: 5 minutes

  - You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Management scopes" entry in the [Role management permissions](role-management-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

  - You must use the Shell to perform these procedures.

  - Before you can remove a scope, you must remove the scope from any management role assignments that might be using it. For more information about how to remove a scope from a role assignment, see [Change a role assignment](change-a-role-assignment-exchange-2013-help.md).

  - For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).

Remove-ManagementScope "Dublin Servers"
