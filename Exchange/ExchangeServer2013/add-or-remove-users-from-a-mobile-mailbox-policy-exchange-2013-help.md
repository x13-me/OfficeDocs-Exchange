# Add or remove users from a mobile mailbox policy

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


A mobile device mailbox policy allows you to apply a common set of security and mobile device settings to a group of users. You can create multiple mobile device mailbox policies.


> [!WARNING]
> When you install Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, a default mobile device mailbox policy is created and all users are automatically assigned this policy.



For additional management tasks related to mobile device mailbox policies, see [Mobile device mailbox policies](mobile-device-mailbox-policies-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

  - Estimated time to complete each procedure: 5 minutes.
