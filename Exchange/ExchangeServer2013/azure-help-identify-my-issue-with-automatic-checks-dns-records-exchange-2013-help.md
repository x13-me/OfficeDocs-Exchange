# Azure: Help Identify My issue with Automatic Checks - DNS Records

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

One of the most common configuration setup issues is incorrectly configuring DNS records. You can use the automatic checks listed below to validate your configuration and help you update your environment.

If you already have an user account, select Sign In. You don't need an Azure ID account. You might be asked for a user account again when the checks run. If so, your user account is in the format of username@youroffice365login.domain and your password.
