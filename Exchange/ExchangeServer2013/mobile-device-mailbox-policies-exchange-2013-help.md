# Mobile device mailbox policies

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


In Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, you can create mobile device mailbox policies to apply a common set of policies or security settings to a collection of users. After you deploy Exchange ActiveSync in your Exchange 2013 organization, you can create new mobile device mailbox policies or modify existing policies. When you install Exchange 2013, a default mobile device mailbox policy is created. All users are automatically assigned this default mobile device mailbox policy.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows Phone 7 mobile phones only support a subset of all Exchange ActiveSync mailbox policy settings. For a complete list, see Windows Phone 7 Synchronization.




> [!WARNING]
> The iOS7 fingerprint reader is not supported as a device password. If you enable the fingerprint reader to secure your iOS7 device, you will still need to create and enter a password if your mobile device mailbox policies require a password.



## Overview of mobile device mailbox policies

You can use mobile device mailbox policies to manage many different settings. These include the following:

  - Require a password

  - Specify the minimum password length

  - Require a number or special character in the password

  - Designate how long a device can be inactive before requiring the user to re-enter a password

  - Wipe a device after a specific number of failed password attempts

For more information about all the settings you can configure, see Mobile device policy settings.

## Managing Exchange ActiveSync mailbox policies

Mobile device mailbox policies can be created in the Exchange Administration Center (EAC) or the Exchange Management Shell. If you create a policy in the EAC, you can configure only a subset of the available settings. You can configure the rest of the settings using the Shell.

## Windows Phone 7 synchronization

If you have Windows Phone 7 mobile phones in your organization, these phones will experience synchronization problems if certain Exchange ActiveSync mailbox policy properties are configured. To allow Windows Phone 7 mobile phones to synchronize with an Exchange mailbox, either set the **AllowNonProvisionableDevices** property to True or only configure the following Exchange ActiveSync mailbox policy properties:

  - AllowSimplePassword

  - BlockInternetSharing

  - BlockRemoteDesktop

  - DisableDesktopSync

  - DisableIrDA

  - DisableRemovableStorage

  - DeviceWipeThreshold

  - MinPasswordLength

  - IdleTimeoutFrequencyValue

  - PasswordExpiration

  - PasswordHistory

  - PasswordRequired

## Mobile device mailbox policy settings

The following table summarizes the settings you can specify using mobile device mailbox policies.
