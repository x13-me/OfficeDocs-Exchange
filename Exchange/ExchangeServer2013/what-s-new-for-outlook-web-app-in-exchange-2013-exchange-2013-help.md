# What's new for Outlook Web App in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

For Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, we've added several new features to Microsoft Outlook Web App and updated its design.

> [!NOTE]
> For more details about using Outlook Web App in your Exchange Server 2013 organization, see <A href="outlook-web-app-exchange-2013-help.md">Outlook Web App</A>.<BR>Outlook Web App users in your organization now have the ability to add public folders to, or remove them from, their Favorites. Previously, this could only be done in Outlook.

## Apps in Outlook Web App

We've added several apps for Outlook: Bing Maps, Suggested Appointments, and Action Items. These apps are integrated with Outlook and Outlook Web App and extend the information and functionality of messages and calendar items.

Apps in Outlook attempt to anticipate your needs and automatically propose actions you might want to take by using the contents of the email message. For example, if an email message contains a street address, the Bing Maps app offers you a Bing tab with a quick link to a map and directions. Or, if a phrase in the email message suggests a possible action item, the Action Items app creates a suggested Task for your review. An offer to meet is suggested as an Appointment to be added to your calendar, thanks to the Suggested Appointments app.

Apps for Outlook aren't dependent on the version of Exchange Server that you're using. You won't have to worry about breaking or losing any apps for Outlook that you have added when you upgrade Exchange servers or move to a new Exchange version.

Administrators can use the Exchange admin center (EAC) to manage the apps available to users in the organization. Users can then manage their apps. Administrators can also allow users to download apps from Office.com. For more information about the EAC, see [Exchange admin center in Exchange 2013](exchange-admin-center-in-exchange-2013-exchange-2013-help.md).

In addition, we encourage third-party developers to create additional apps for Outlook and then offer them at Office.com. To learn more, see [Deploy and publish Office Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/publish/publish) for background information and [Outlook add-ins overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/outlook-add-ins-overview) for detailed information about building apps for Outlook.

## People

- Now, users can link multiple entries for the same person and view the information in a single contact card. For example, if a user has two entries for Holly Holt in his Contacts folder, one entry copied from the organization's address list and one entry that he added manually, he can link the two entries in his Contacts folder and view all the information in one place. Contact linking is done automatically, but the user can also manually link and unlink contacts.

- Connected accounts have been extended to include the ability to connect to a user's LinkedIn account. After the link is established, Outlook Web App automatically adds the user's LinkedIn contacts to the Contacts folder.

## Calendar

- Users can now view multiple calendars in a merged view. Entries from each calendar have their own color, making it easy for users to identify which calendar an entry belongs to. In the day view, users can view multiple calendars in a merged view or in separate columns.

- The month view now includes an agenda for the selected day, providing users with helpful information as they review the day's activities.

- In all calendar views, users can click an item to view a pop-up of the item's details. In addition to the details, controls are now available to accept or decline the item if it's a meeting, to edit or delete if it's an appointment, or, if a meeting item, to join the meeting if an online meeting link is included.

## Tablets and smartphones

Outlook Web App emphasizes a streamlined user interface that also supports the use of touch, enhancing the mobile device experience with Exchange.

## Supported browsers

To experience all Outlook Web App features, use one of the operating system and browser combinations labeled "Best", as noted in the tables below. Outlook Web App is supported by many operating system and web browser combinations, but not all Outlook Web App features are available in all combinations. Some browsers support only the light version of Outlook Web App.

## Supported browsers on desktop and laptop computers

In the table below, the following definitions apply:

- Best: All Outlook Web App features are supported.

- Good: Most Outlook Web App features are supported.

- Light: The browser displays the light version of Outlook Web App

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - In previous versions, Outlook Web App had a built-in spell checker. In Exchange Server 2013, Outlook Web App relies on the web browser for spell checking, which Internet Explorer prior to version 10 doesn't provide.
> 
> - Microsoft 365 users will be limited to the light version of Outlook Web App when using Internet Explorer 8. Users whose mailboxes are on a locally managed Exchange server will continue to see the standard version of Outlook Web App when using Internet Explorer 8, but may experience slow or otherwise unsatisfactory performance.

## OWA for Devices app

The OWA for Devices app lets users in an Exchange 2013 on-premises deployment with a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 mailbox or in a Microsoft 365-only or Office 365-only organization use their iPhone or iPad access their mailbox. The OWA for iPhone and OWA for iPad apps simplify signing in to their mailbox and allows them access their mailbox even when they don't have an Internet connection. The OWA for iPhone or OWA for iPad apps are recommended instead of using your iPhone's or iPad's browser. For Exchange on-premises deployments, you need to enable push notifications for OWA for Devices to work, see [Configuring push notifications proxying for OWA for Devices](configuring-push-notifications-proxying-for-owa-for-devices-exchange-2013-help.md).

You can download the OWA for iPhone and OWA for iPad apps from the Apple App Store by searching for OWA for iPhone or OWA for iPad or download them from [OWA for iPhone in the Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/owa-for-iphone/id659503543) or [OWA for iPad in the Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/owa-for-ipad/id659524331). The table below shows the versions of iPad and iPhone that are supported.
