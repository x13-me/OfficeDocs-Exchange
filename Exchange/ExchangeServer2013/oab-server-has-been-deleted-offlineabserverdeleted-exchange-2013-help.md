Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because its attempt to install the Client Access server role failed. The Exchange Mailbox server designated to host the Offline Address Book (OAB) has been deleted.

Exchange 2007 setup requires that there be a valid Exchange Mailbox server hosting OAB generation for the Client Access server role installation to continue.

To address this issue, designate a valid Exchange Mailbox server as OAB generation host, and then rerun Exchange 2007 setup.

For information about how to designate an Exchange server to be the host for Offline Address Book generation, see "How to Create an Offline Address Book" ([https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb124270(v=exchg.80)](/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb124270(v=exchg.80))) in the Exchange 2007 product documentation.
