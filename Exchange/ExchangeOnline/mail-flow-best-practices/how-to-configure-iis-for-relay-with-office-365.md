# How to configure IIS for relay with Office 365

When you set up a multifunction device or application to send email through Office 365, there are some cases where the device or application can't connect directly to Office 365. In these cases, you need to set up Internet Information Services (IIS) to work as an intermediary.

You might want to do this in the following scenarios:

- You don't have an on-premises messaging system any longer

- You have line-of-business (LOB) programs or devices in an on-premises environment

- Your LOB programs and devices have to send email messages to remote domains and to your Exchange Online mailboxes

Before proceeding, review [How to set up a multifunction device or application to send email using Office 365](how-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-office-3.md) as there may be an available option that doesn't require setting up an additional server to relay.

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions can be modified for other SMTP relays that you might have in your organization.

## What you need to know before you begin

- Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes

- Your on-premises domain must be added as an accepted domain in Office 365. For example, if the account you're relaying from is bob@tailspintoys.com, you have to add tailspintoys.com as an accepted domain in Office 365.

- Your on-premises account must also be either an Exchange Online-licensed user in Office 365 or an alternative email address of an Exchange Online-licensed user. For example, if the account that you're relaying from is printer@tailspintoys.com and you want to relay through bob@contoso.com (an Office 365 user), you have to add printer@tailspintoys.com as an alternate email address to bob@contoso.com.

## How do you know this worked?

You can test SMTP relay services without using an separate LOB application or device.

To test SMTP relay services, use the following steps.

1. Create a text file using Notepad or another text editor. The file should contain the following code. Replace the source and destination email addresses with the addresses you will use to relay SMTP.

  ```
  FROM: <source email address>
  TO: <destination email address>
  SUBJECT: Test email
  This is a test email sent from my SMTP server

  ```

2. Save the text file as Email.txt.

3. Copy the Email.txt file into the following folder: C:\InetPub\MailRoot\Pickup.

4. After a short time, the file should automatically be moved to the C:\InetPub\MailRoot\Queue folder. When the SMTP server delivers the mail, the file is automatically deleted from the local folder.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If the SMTP server can't deliver the message, a non-delivery report (NDR) is created in the C:\InetPub\MailRoot\BadMail folder. You can use this NDR to diagnose delivery issues.
