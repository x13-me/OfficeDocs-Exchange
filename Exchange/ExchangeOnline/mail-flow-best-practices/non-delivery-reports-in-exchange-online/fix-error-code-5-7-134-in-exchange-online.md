# Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.7.134 in Exchange Online

It's frustrating when you get an error after sending an email message. This topic describes what you can do if you see error code 550 5.7.134 in a non-delivery report also known as an NDR, bounce message, delivery status notification, or DSN). You'll see this automated notification when the recipient is a mailbox that's configured to reject messages from external senders (senders from outside the organization).

### I got this bounce message. How do I fix it?

Only an email admin in the recipient's organization can fix this issue. Contact the email admin and refer them to this information so they can try to resolve the issue for you.

## I'm an email admin. How do I fix this?

The two methods that will allow an external sender to send messages to the mailbox in your organization are described in the following sections.

To open the New Exchange admin center (EAC), see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/exchange-admin-center).


To open the Classic EAC, click **Classic Exchange admin center** on the left pane of the **Exchange admin center** (New) home screen, as shown in the image below.

### Method 1: Allow all internal and external senders to send messages to this mailbox

**In New EAC**

1. Navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. Select a user mailbox from the list and click it. The user mailbox properties dialog box appears.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/user-mailboxes-properties.png" alt-text="The screen displaying the properties of the chosen user mailbox":::

3. Under **Mail flow settings**, click **Manage mail flow settings**. The **Manage mail flow settings** dialog box appears.

4. In the **Message delivery restriction** pane, click **Edit**. The **Message delivery restrictions** dialog box appears.

5. Under **Accept messages from**:
    - Choose **All senders**.
    - Clear the check box for **Check if all senders are authenticated**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/settings-message-delivery-restrictions.png" alt-text="The screen on which the user can define settings for message delivery restrictions":::

6. Click **Save**.

**In Classic EAC**

1. In the Classic EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes** > select the mailbox from the list, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ebd260e4-3556-4fb0-b0bb-cc489773042c.gif).

4. Click **OK**, and then click **Save**.

### Method 2: Use the mailbox's allowed senders list

Instead of allowing all external senders to send messages to this mailbox, you can use the mailbox's allowed senders list to selectively allow messages from all internal senders and the specified external senders.

**Notes**:

- To add an external sender to a mailbox's allowed senders list, you must first create a [mail contact](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-contacts) or a [mail user](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-users) to represent the external sender in your organization.

- To add everyone in your organization to a mailbox's allowed sender's list, you can create a [distribution group](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-distribution-groups/manage-distribution-groups) or a [dynamic distribution group](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups) that contains everyone in your organization. After you create this group, you can add it to the mailbox's allowed senders list.

- The mailbox's allowed senders list is completely different from the organization's allowed senders list for anti-spam that you manage in the EAC at **Protection** \> **Spam filter**.

To configure the mailbox's allowed senders list, do the following steps:

**In New EAC**

1. Navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. Select a user mailbox from the list and click it. The user mailbox properties dialog box appears.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/user-mailboxes-properties.png" alt-text="The screen displaying the properties of the chosen user mailbox":::

3. Under **Mail flow settings**, click **Manage mail flow settings**. The **Manage mail flow settings** dialog box appears.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/manage-mail-flow-settings-screen.png" alt-text="The Manage Mail Flow Settings screen":::

4. In the **Message delivery restriction** pane, click **Edit**. The **Message delivery restrictions** dialog box appears.

5. Under **Accept messages from** section:
  - Clear the check box for **Check if all senders are authenticated**
  - Select **Selected senders**.
  
<include the image mdr-screen-select-senders.png>

  - Click **+ Add sender**. The **Accept messages from** dialog box appears.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/accept-messages-from-screen.png" alt-text="The screen displaying the Accept Messages From pane":::

  - Check the check box of the internal-senders group and the specific external users whom you want to add.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/setting-senders.png" alt-text="The screen on which the senders to be added to the group are chosen":::

  - Click **Confirm**.
