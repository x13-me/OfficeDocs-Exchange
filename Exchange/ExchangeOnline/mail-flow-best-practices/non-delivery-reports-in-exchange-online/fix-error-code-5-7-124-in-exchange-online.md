# Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.7.124 in Exchange Online

It's frustrating when you get an error after sending an email message. This topic describes what you can do if you see status code 550 5.7.124 or 5.7.124 in a non-delivery report (also known as an NDR, bounce message, delivery status notification, or DSN). You'll see this automated notification when the sender isn't specified in the group's allowed senders list (directly or as a member of a group). Depending how the group is configured, even the group's owner might need to be in the group's allowed senders list in order to send messages to the group.

## I got this bounce message. How do I fix this issue?

Typically, members of a group can send messages to the group. If the group is in your Exchange Online organization, you can try to join the group in Outlook or Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App). For instructions, see [Join a group in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/2e59e19c-b872-44c8-ae84-0acc4b79c45d).

You might have to wait for the group's owner to approve your request to join the group before you can successfully send messages to it. If the group isn't in your organization, or if the group doesn't allow requests to join, then you'll need to ask the group owner to add you to the allowed senders list. You'll find instructions for finding the group owner in the NDR.

## I'm the group owner or email admin. How do I fix this issue?

The two methods that will allow the sender to send messages to the group are described in the following sections.

To open the Exchange admin center (EAC), see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](../../exchange-admin-center.md).

### Method 1: Add the sender to the group's existing allowed senders list

**For New EAC**

1.  Navigate to **Recipients** \> **Groups**.

2. Click the **Distribution list** tab.

3. Select a group from the list and click it. The group properties screen appears.

4. Click the **Settings** tab.

5. Under **Delivery management**, click **Edit delivery management**. The **Delivery management** screen appears.

6. Under **Sender options**, choose the option **Only allow messages from people inside my organization**.

**For Classic EAC**

2. In the group properties dialog box that opens, go to **Delivery management** and then click **Add** ![Add icon](../../media/8ee52980-254b-440b-99a2-18d068de62d3.gif).

   ![Add an email address to the allowed senders list](../../media/bfa84c19-f972-4428-9001-47bebd8b9125.png)

3. In the **Select Allowed Senders** dialog box that opens, select the sender or a group that the sender is a member of.

4. Add the sender or a group to the existing allowed senders list.

5. When you're finished, click **OK**.

6. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> To add an external sender to a group's allowed senders list, you must first create a [mail contact](../../recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-contacts.md) or a [mail user](../../recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-users.md) to represent the external sender in your organization.

### Method 2: Allow all internal and external senders to send messages to this group

If you decide that you don't need to restrict the message senders to this group, you can remove the restrictions so anyone can send messages to this group:

**For New EAC**

1. Navigate to **Recipients** \> **Groups**.

2. Click the **Distribution list** tab.

3. Select a group from the list and click it. The group properties screen appears.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/distribution-list-group-details.png" alt-text="The screen displaying properties of the chosen distribution list group":::

4. Click the **Settings** tab.

5. Under **Delivery management**, click **Edit delivery management**. The **Delivery management** screen appears.

6. Under **Sender options**, choose **Allow messages from people inside and outside my organization**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/delivery-management-all-senders.png" alt-text="The screen on which the user chooses the option to allow internal and external members to be set as senders":::

7. Click **Save changes**.

**For Classic EAC**

1. In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Groups** \> select the group from the list, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ebd260e4-3556-4fb0-b0bb-cc489773042c.gif).

2. In the group properties dialog box that opens, go to **Delivery management**.

3. In the **Distribution Group** box select **Delivery management** and configure the following settings:

   - Remove any entries in the allowed senders list by selecting one entry, pressing CTRL + A to select all entries, and then clicking **Remove** ![Remove icon](../../media/adf01106-cc79-475c-8673-065371c1897b.gif).

     ![Removing allowed senders from a distribution list](../../media/c135fe59-4c77-43e1-b514-da8dbe4b5fb6.png)

   - Select **Senders inside and outside of my organization**.

4. When you're finished, click **Save**.

## More information about groups

Groups with more than 5,000 members have the following restrictions automatically applied to them:

- Senders to the group must be members of the group.
- Messages sent to the group require the approval of a moderator. To configure moderation for a group, see [Configure moderated recipients in Exchange Online](../../recipients-in-exchange-online/moderated-recipients-exo/configure-moderated-recipients-exo.md).
- Large messages can't be sent to the group. However, senders of large messages will receive a different NDR. For more information about large messages, see [Distribution group limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#distribution-group-limits).
