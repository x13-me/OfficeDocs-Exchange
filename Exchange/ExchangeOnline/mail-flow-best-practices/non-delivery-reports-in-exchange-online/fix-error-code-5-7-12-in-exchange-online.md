# Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.7.12 in Exchange Online

It's frustrating when you get an error after sending an email message. This topic describes what you can do if you see status code 550 5.7.12 or 5.7.12 in a non-delivery report (also known as an NDR, bounce message, delivery status notification, or DSN). You'll see this automated notification when the recipient is configured to reject messages that are sent from outside of its organization.

## I got this bounce message. How do I fix it?

 Only an email admin in the recipient's organization can fix this issue. Contact the email admin and refer them to this information so they can try to resolve the issue for you.

The two methods that will allow an external sender to send messages to the recipient in your organization are described in the following sections.

To open the Exchange admin center (EAC), see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](../../exchange-admin-center.md).

   5. Click **OK**, and then click **Save**.

### Method 2: Use the recipient's allowed senders list

Instead of allowing all external senders to send messages to this recipient, you can use the recipient's allowed senders list to selectively allow messages from all internal senders and the specified external senders.

**Notes**:

- To add an external sender to a recipient's allowed senders list, you must first create a [mail contact](../../recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-contacts.md) or a [mail user](../../recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-users.md) to represent the external sender in your organization.

- To add everyone in your organization to a recipient's allowed sender's list, you can create a [distribution group](../../recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-distribution-groups/manage-distribution-groups.md) or a [dynamic distribution group](../../recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups.md) that contains everyone in your organization. After you create this group, you can add it to the recipient's allowed senders list.

- The recipient's allowed senders list is completely different from the organization's allowed senders list for anti-spam that you manage in the EAC at **Protection** \> **Spam filter**.

To configure the recipient's allowed senders list, open the EAC and use one of the following procedures based on the recipient type:

- **User mailboxes**:

- **New EAC**
   
   1. Navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.
    
   2. Select a user mailbox from the list and click it. The mailbox properties screen appears.
   
   3. Under **Mail flow settings**, click **Manage mail flow settings**. The **Manage mail flow settings** screen appears.
    
   4. In the **Message delivery restriction** pane, click **Edit**. The **Message delivery restrictions** screen appears.
    
   5. Configure the following settings under the **Accept messages from** section:
   
       - Clear the check box for **Require senders to be authenticated**.
       - Choose the radio button for **Selected senders**.
       - Click **+ Add sender**.
       
       :::image type="content" source="../../media/specifying-senders.png" alt-text="The screen on which specific external senders can be set":::

       :::image type="content" source="../../media/confirming-the-specified-users.png" alt-text="The screen on which the specific senders are chosen":::
