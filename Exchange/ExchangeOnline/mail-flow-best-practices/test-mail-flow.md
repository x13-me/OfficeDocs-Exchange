# Test mail flow by validating your connectors

To validate and troubleshoot mail flow from Microsoft 365 or Office 365 to your organization's email server (also called on-premises server), validate your connectors. You can set up and validate connectors on the **connectors** page in the Exchange admin center (EAC). The built-in validation tests that your mail flow from Microsoft 365 or Office 365 reaches:

- Your organization's email server

- A partner organization.

For more information, see [Validate connectors](use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/validate-connectors.md)

Mail flow issues can also happen when your MX record is not setup correctly. To verify your MX record, see [Find and fix issues after adding your domain or DNS records](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues).

> [!NOTE]
> These tests replace Microsoft 365 or Office 365 mail flow troubleshooting that was previously available in the [Remote Connectivity Analyzer](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/o365).
