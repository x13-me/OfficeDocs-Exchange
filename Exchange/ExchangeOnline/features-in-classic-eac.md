You can also get to the Classic Exchange admin center directly by using a URL. To do this, go to [https://outlook.office365.com/ecp](https://outlook.office365.com/ecp) and sign in using your credentials.

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to use a private browsing session (not a regular session) to access the Exchange admin center using the direct URL. This will prevent the credential that you are currently logged on with from being used. To open an InPrivate Browsing session in Microsoft Edge or an incognito window in Google Chrome, press CTRL+SHIFT+N. To open an InPrivate Browsing session in Microsoft Edge Legacy, Internet Explorer, or a Private Browsing session in Mozilla Firefox, press CTRL+SHIFT+P.

### Tabs

The tabs are your second level of navigation. Each of the feature areas contains various tabs, each representing a complete feature.

### Toolbar

When you click most tabs, you'll see a toolbar. The toolbar has icons that perform a specific action.

### List view

When you select a tab, in most cases you'll see a list view. The list view in the Classic Exchange admin center is designed to remove limitations that existed in Exchange Control Panel.

In Exchange Online, the viewable limit from within the Classic Exchange admin center list view is approximately 10,000 objects. In addition, paging is included so you can page to the results. In the **Recipients** list view, you can also configure page size and export the data to a CSV file.

### Details pane

When you select an item from the list view, information about that object is displayed in the details pane.

 **To bulk edit several items**: press the CTRL key, select the objects you want to bulk edit, and use the options in the details pane.

### Centers, Me tile, and Help

The Centers tile allows you to change from one admin center to another. The Me tile allows you to sign out of the Classic Exchange admin center and sign in as a different user. From the Help ![Help Icon.](media/ITPro_EAC_HelpIcon.gif) drop-down menu, you can perform the following actions:

- **Help**: Click ![Help Icon.](media/ITPro_EAC_HelpIcon.gif) to view the online help content.

- **Disable Help bubble**: The Help bubble displays contextual help for fields when you create or edit an object. You can turn off the Help bubble or turn it on if it has been   disabled.
