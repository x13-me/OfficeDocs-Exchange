# Alert policy

An alert policy is the mechanism that enables you to track events related to mail flow in the new Exchange Admin Center (EAC).

## Types of alert policies

There are two types of alert policies, namely [System](#system-policy) and [Custom](#custom-policy).

### System policy

System policy is created by the system, by default. A **System** policy automatically maps a newly created tenant to it.

### Custom policy

Custom policy is the policy that can be manually created by the user/tenant.

## Privileges for management of alert policy

- **Security administrator** privileges are required for the management of an alert policy. 
> [!NOTE]
> For information on the tasks involved in the management of an alert policy, see [User tasks on alert policies](#user-tasks-on-alert-policies). 

- **Security reader** privileges are sufficient if the tenant wants to just read/view an alert policy.

## User tasks on alert policies

A user with **security administrator** privileges can perform the following tasks on an alert policy:

- **Creation**: A user with **security administrator** privileges can create an alert policy, which is a custom alert policy. For information on how to create an alert policy, see [Create alert policy](#create-alert-policy). 
- **Edit**: A user can edit both the **system** and **custom** policies. For more information, see [Edit alert policy](#edit-alert-policy).
- **Disable**: A user can disable both the **system** and **custom** policies. For more information, see [Disable alert policy](#disable-alert-policy).  
- **Disable email notifications of alert policies**: A user can disable the email notifications pertaining to both **system** and **custom** policies. For more information, see [Disable email notifications](#disable-email-notifications).
- **View**: A user can view alert policies (system or custom) on the **Alerts** screen. For more information, see [View/read alert policy](#viewread-alert-policy).
