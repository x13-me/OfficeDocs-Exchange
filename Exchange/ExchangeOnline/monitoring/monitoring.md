# Monitoring, reporting, and message tracing in Exchange Online

Exchange Online offers many different reports that can help you determine the overall status and health of your organization. There are also tools to help you troubleshoot specific events (such as a message not arriving to its intended recipients), and auditing reports to aid with compliance requirements. The following table describes the reports and troubleshooting tools that are available to Exchange Online administrators.

<sup>1</sup> DLP is only available in certain Exchange Online subscription plans. For information, see the **Data Loss Prevention** entries in the [Exchange Online Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description).

<sup>2</sup> Defender for Office 365 is available in Office 365 Enterprise E5, but you can also purchase Defender for Office 365 as an add-on to other subscription plans.

<sup>3</sup> Many of the original reporting cmdlets in Exchange Online PowerShell have been deprecated (the cmdlets are available, but they don't return useful data). For a list of available and unavailable reporting cmdlets, see [Exchange reporting cmdlets](/powershell/module/exchange/#reporting).

## Reporting and message trace data availability and latency

The following table describes when Exchange Online reporting and message trace data is available and for how long.

****

|Report type|Data available for (look back period)|Latency|
|---|---|---|
|Mailbox summary reports|60 days|Message data aggregation is mostly complete within 24-48 hours. Some minor incremental aggregated changes may occur for up to 5 days.|
|Mail protection summary reports|90 days|Message data aggregation is mostly complete within 24-48 hours. Some minor incremental aggregated changes may occur for up to 5 days.|
|Mail protection detail reports|90 days|For detail data that's less than 7 days old, data should appear within 24 hours but may not be complete until 48 hours. Some minor incremental changes may occur for up to 5 days. <br/> To view detail reports for messages that are greater than 7 days old, results may take up to a few hours.|
|Message trace data|90 days|When you run a message trace for messages that are less than 7 days old, the messages should appear within 5-30 minutes. <br/> When you run a message trace for messages that are greater than 7 days old, results may take up to a few hours.|

> [!NOTE]
> Data availability and latency doesn't depend on the user interface (it's the same in the admin centers as in PowerShell).
