# Inbound messages and Outbound messages reports in the new EAC

The **Inbound messages report** and the **Outbound messages report** in the new Exchange admin center (new EAC) display information about email entering and leaving your organization. Specifically, the **Inbound messages report** shows information about email coming into your organization from the internet and over connectors. The **Outbound messages report** displays information about email leaving your organization to the internet and over connectors. Both reports also show the TLS encryption level that's being used.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the report shows data for the last 7 days. If the report is empty, try changing the date range.

The overview section contains the following charts:

- **Message volume**: Shows the number of inbound or outbound messages to or from the internet and over connectors.

- **Messages by TLS used**: Shows the TLS encryption level. If you hover over a specific color in the chart, you'll see the number of messages for that specific version of TLS.

The **Connector report details** section shows the following information about each specific connector or email from the internet:

- **Date**
- **Connector direction and name**
- **Connector type**
- **Forced TLS?**
- **No TLS**
- **TLS 1.0**
- **TLS 1.1**
- **TLS 1.2**
- **Volume**

To quickly filter the results, click **Search** ![Search icon](../../media/modern-eac-search-icon.png) and start typing a value.

To filter the results by date range or connector name, use the boxes. You can specify a date range up to 90 days.

For more advanced filters that you can also save and use later, click **Filter** ![Filter icon](../../media/modern-eac-filter-icon.png) and select **New filter**. In the **Custom filter** flyout that appears, enter the following information:

- **Name your filter**: Enter a unique name.

- Click **Add new clause**. A clause contains the following elements that you need to enter:

  - **Field**: Select **Date**, **Connector direction**, **Connector type**, **Forced TLS**, **No TLS**, **TLS 1.0**, **TLS 1.1**, **TLS 1.2**, or **Volume**.

  - **Operator**: Select **starts with** or **is**.

  - **Value**: Enter the value you want to search for.

  You can click **Add new clause** as many times as you need. Multiple clauses use AND logic (\<Clause1\> AND \<Clause2\>...).

  To remove a clause, click **Remove** ![Remove icon](../../media/modern-eac-remove-icon.png)

  When you're finished, click **Save**. The new filter is automatically loaded, and the results are changed based on the filter. This is the same result as clicking **Filter** and selecting the customer filter from the list.

  To unload a existing filter (return to the default list), click **Filter** ![Active filter icon](../../media/modern-eac-filter-active-icon.png) and select **Clear all filters**.

Click **Export** to export the displayed results to a .csv file.
