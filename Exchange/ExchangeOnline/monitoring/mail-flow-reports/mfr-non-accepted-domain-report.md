# Non-accepted domain report in the new Exchange admin center

The **Non-accepted domain** report in the new Exchange admin center (new EAC) displays information about messages from your on-premises email organization where the sender's domain isn't configured as an accepted domain in your Microsoft 365 organization.

Microsoft 365 might throttle these messages if we have data to prove that the intent of these messages is malicious. Therefore, it's important for you to understand what's happening and to fix the issue.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the report shows data for the last 7 days. If the report is empty, try changing the date range.

The overview section contains a chart that shows the number of messages sent per connector:

![Overview of the Auto forwarded messages report](../../media/mfr-non-accepted-domain-report.png)

The **Non-Accepted domain details** section contains the following information:

- **Date**
- **Inbound connector name**
- **Sender domain**
- **Count**
- **Sample messages**: This field contains the internet message IDs (also known as the Client IDs) of a sample of the original messages. This value is stored in the **Message-ID** header field in the message header and is constant for the lifetime of the message.

To quickly filter the results, click **Search** ![Search icon](../../media/modern-eac-search-icon.png) and start typing a value.

To filter the results by date range or connector name, use the boxes. You can specify a date range up to 90 days.

For more advanced filters that you can also save and use later, click **Filter** ![Filter icon](../../media/modern-eac-filter-icon.png) and select **New filter**. In the **Custom filter** flyout that appears, enter the following information:

- **Name your filter**: Enter a unique name.

- Click **Add new clause**. A clause contains the following elements that you need to enter:

  - **Field**: Select **Date**, **Inbound connector**, **Sender domain**, **Count** or **Sample messages**.

  - **Operator**: Select **starts with** or **is**.

  - **Value**: Enter the value you want to search for.

  You can click **Add new clause** as many times as you need. Multiple clauses use AND logic (\<Clause1\> AND \<Clause2\>...).

  To remove a clause, click **Remove** ![Remove icon](../../media/modern-eac-remove-icon.png)

  When you're finished, click **Save**. The new filter is automatically loaded, and the results are changed based on the filter. This is the same result as clicking **Filter** and selecting the customer filter from the list.

  To unload a existing filter (return to the default list), click **Filter** ![Active filter icon](../../media/modern-eac-filter-active-icon.png) and select **Clear all filters**.

Click **Export** to export the displayed results to a .csv file.
