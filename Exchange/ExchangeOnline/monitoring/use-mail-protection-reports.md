# Use mail protection reports to view data about malware, spam, and rule detections in Exchange Online

If you're an Exchange Online or Exchange Online Protection (EOP) admin, there's a good chance you'd like to monitor how much spam and malware is being detected, or how often your mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) are being matched. With the interactive mail protection reports in the Microsoft 365 security center, you can quickly get a visual report of summary data, and drill-down into details about individual messages, for as far back as 90 days.

## Reports in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>), go to **Reports** \> **Email & collaboration** \> **Email & collaboration reports**. and sign in using your work or school account. Or, to go directly to the **Email & collaboration reports** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/emailandcollabreport>

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator or have appropriate permissions assigned in order to use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. For details, see [Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/permissions-microsoft-365-security-center).

The following table describes the types of reports that are available, how to find them, and where to go to learn more.
