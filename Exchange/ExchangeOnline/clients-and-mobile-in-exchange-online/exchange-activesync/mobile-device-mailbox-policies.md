# Mobile device mailbox policies in Exchange Online

In Office 365, you can create mobile device mailbox policies to apply a common set of policies or security settings to a collection of users. A default mobile device mailbox policy is created in every Office 365 organization.

## Overview of mobile device mailbox policies

You can use mobile device mailbox policies to manage many different settings. These include the following:

- Require a password

- Specify the minimum password length

- Allow a numeric PIN or require special characters in the password

- Designate how long a device can be inactive before requiring the user to re-enter a password

- Wipe a device after a specific number of failed password attempts

## Managing Exchange ActiveSync mailbox policies

Mobile device mailbox policies can be created in the Exchange admin center (EAC) or Exchange Online PowerShell. If you create a policy in the EAC, you can configure only a subset of the available settings. You can configure the rest of the settings using Exchange Online PowerShell.

## Mobile device mailbox policy settings

The following table summarizes the settings you can specify using mobile device mailbox policies.

**Mobile device mailbox policy settings**

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Allow Bluetooth|This setting specifies whether a mobile device allows Bluetooth connections. The available options are Disable, HandsFree Only, and Allow. The default value is Allow.|
|Allow Browser|This setting specifies whether Pocket Internet Explorer is allowed on the mobile device. This setting doesn't affect third-party browsers installed on the mobile device. The default value is `$true`.|
|Allow Camera|This setting specifies whether the mobile device camera can be used. The default value is `$true`.|
|Allow Consumer EMail|This setting specifies whether the mobile device user can configure a personal email account (either POP3 or IMAP4) on the mobile device. The default value is `$true`. This setting doesn't control access to email accounts that are using third-party mobile device email programs.|
|Allow Desktop Sync|This setting specifies whether the mobile device can synchronize with a computer through a cable, Bluetooth, or IrDA connection. The default value is `$true`.|
|Allow External Device Management|This setting specifies whether an external device management program is allowed to manage the mobile device.|
|Allow HTML Email|This setting specifies whether email synchronized to the mobile device can be in HTML format. If this setting is set to `$false`, all email is converted to plain text.|

|Allow non-provisionable devices|This setting specifies whether mobile devices that may not support application of all policy settings are allowed to connect to Office 365 by using Exchange ActiveSync. Allowing non-provisionable mobile devices has security implications. For example, some non-provisionable devices may not be able to implement an organization's password requirements.|
|Allow POPIMAPEmail|This setting specifies whether the user can configure a POP3 or an IMAP4 email account on the mobile device. The default value is `$true`. This setting doesn't control access by third-party email programs.|
|Allow Remote Desktop|This setting specifies whether the mobile device can initiate a remote desktop connection. The default value is `$true`.|
|Allow simple password|This setting enables or disables the ability to use a simple password such as 1111 or 1234. The default value is `$true`.|
|Allow S/MIME encryption algorithm negotiation|This setting specifies whether the messaging application on the mobile device can negotiate the encryption algorithm if a recipient's certificate doesn't support the specified encryption algorithm.|
|Allow S/MIME software certificates|This setting specifies whether S/MIME software certificates are allowed on the mobile device.|
|Allow storage card|This setting specifies whether the mobile device can access information that's stored on a storage card.|
|Allow text messaging|This setting specifies whether text messaging is allowed from the mobile device. The default value is `$true`.|
|Allow unsigned applications|This setting specifies whether unsigned applications can be installed on the mobile device. The default value is `$true`.|
|Allow unsigned installation packages|This setting specifies whether an unsigned installation package can be run on the mobile device. The default value is `$true`.|
|Allow Wi-Fi|This setting specifies whether wireless Internet access is allowed on the mobile device. The default value is `$true`.|
|Alphanumeric password required|This setting requires that a password contains numeric and non-numeric characters. The default value is `$true`.|
|Approved Application List|This setting stores a list of approved applications that can be run on the mobile device.|
|Attachments enabled|This setting enables attachments to be downloaded to the mobile device. The default value is `$true`.|
|Device encryption enabled|This setting enables encryption on the mobile device. Not all mobile devices can enforce encryption. For more information, see the device and mobile operating system documentation.|
|Device policy refresh interval|This setting specifies how often the mobile device mailbox policy is sent from the server to the mobile device.|
|IRM enabled|This setting specifies whether Information Rights Management (IRM) is enabled on the mobile device.|
|Max attachment size|This setting controls the maximum size of attachments that can be downloaded to the mobile device. The default value is Unlimited.|
|Max calendar age filter| This setting specifies the maximum range of calendar days that can be synchronized to the mobile device. The following values are accepted:  <br/>  All  <br/>  OneDay  <br/>  ThreeDays  <br/>  OneWeek  <br/>  TwoWeeks  <br/>  OneMonth|
|Max email age filter| This setting specifies the maximum number of days of email items to synchronize to the mobile device. The following values are accepted:  <br/>  All  <br/>  OneDay  <br/>  ThreeDays  <br/>  OneWeek  <br/>  TwoWeeks  <br/>  OneMonth|
|Max email body truncation size|This setting specifies the maximum size at which email messages are truncated when synchronized to the mobile device. The value is in kilobytes (KB).|
|Max email HTML body truncation size|This setting specifies the maximum size at which HTML email messages are truncated when synchronized to the mobile device. The value is in kilobytes (KB).|
|Max inactivity time lock|This value specifies the length of time that the mobile device can be inactive before a password is required to reactivate it. You can enter any interval between 30 seconds and 1 hour. The default value is 15 minutes.|
|Max password failed attempts|This setting specifies the number of attempts a user can make to enter the correct password for the mobile device. You can enter any number from 4 through 16. The default value is 8.|
|Min password complex characters|This setting specifies the minimum number of complex characters required in the mobile device's password. A complex character is a character that is not a letter.|
|Min password length|This setting specifies the minimum number of characters in the mobile device password. You can enter any number from 1 through 16. The default value is 4.|
|Password enabled|This setting enables the mobile device password.|
