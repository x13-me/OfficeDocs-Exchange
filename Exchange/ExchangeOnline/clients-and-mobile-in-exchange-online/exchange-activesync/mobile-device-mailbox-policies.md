# Mobile device mailbox policies in Exchange Online

In Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you can create mobile device mailbox policies to apply a common set of policies or security settings to a collection of users. A default mobile device mailbox policy is created in every Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization.

## Overview of mobile device mailbox policies

You can use mobile device mailbox policies to manage many different settings. These include the following:

- Require a password

- Specify the minimum password length

- Allow a numeric PIN or require special characters in the password

- Designate how long a device can be inactive before requiring the user to re-enter a password

- Wipe a device after a specific number of failed password attempts

## Mobile device password settings and biometrics

Many mobile devices support biometrics such as Apple Touch ID or Face ID. Exchange mobile device mailbox policies do not control whether biometrics can be used instead of typing the device PIN. Mobile device mailbox policies can be configured to require a device PIN, but then the users control whether they use biometrics after complying with the device PIN requirement.

Customers that need advanced control over the use of biometrics should consider device enrollment solutions such as Microsoft Intune. See [Deploying Outlook for iOS and Android app configuration settings](../outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune.md) for more information.

## Mobile device password settings and Android

Android 9.0 and earlier versions utilize Android's device admin functionality to manage device password settings defined in a mobile device mailbox policy.

With Android 10.0 and later, Android has removed device admin functionality. Instead, apps that require a screen lock query the device's (or the work profile's) screen lock complexity using the [getPasswordComplexity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#getPasswordComplexity()) API. Apps that require a stronger screen lock direct the user to the system screen lock settings, allowing the user to update the security settings to become compliant. At no time is the app aware of the user's password; the app is only aware of the password complexity level. Android supports the following four password complexity levels:

|Password complexity level |Password requirements  |
|---------|---------|
|None     |No password requirements are configured         |
|Low     |Password can be a pattern or a PIN with either repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences         |
|Medium     |Passwords that meet one of the following criteria:<br/><br/>- PIN with no repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences with a minimum length of 4 characters <br/>- Alphabetic passwords with a minimum length of 4 characters<br/>- Alphanumeric passwords with a minimum length of 4 characters        |
|High     |Passwords that meet one of the following criteria:<br/><br/>- PIN with no repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences with a minimum length of 8 characters<br/>- Alphabetic passwords with a minimum length of 6 characters<br/>- Alphanumeric passwords with a minimum length of 6 characters         |

Android's password complexity levels are mapped to the following Exchange mobile device mailbox policy settings:

|Mobile device mailbox policy setting  |Android password complexity level  |
|---------|---------|
|Password enabled = false     | None        |
|Allow simple password = true<br/>Min password length < 4      |Low         |
|Alphanumeric password required = false<br/>Min password length >= 4<br/>Min password length < 8      |Medium         |
|Alphanumeric password required = true<br/>Min password length < 6      |Medium         |
|Alphanumeric password required = false<br/>Min password length >= 8      |High         |
|Alphanumeric password required = true<br/>Min password length >= 6      |High         |

## Mobile device mailbox policy settings

The following table summarizes the settings you can specify using mobile device mailbox policies.

**Mobile device mailbox policy settings**

## Managing mobile device mailbox policies

Mobile device mailbox policies can be created, modified, or deleted in the Exchange admin center (EAC) or Exchange Online PowerShell. If you create a policy in the EAC, you can configure only a subset of the available settings. You can configure the rest of the settings using Exchange Online PowerShell.

### What do you need to know before you begin?

### Create a new mobile device mailbox policy

#### Use the EAC to create a new mobile device mailbox policy

> [!NOTE]
> You can only set a subset of mobile device mailbox policy settings in the EAC. To set all the mobile device mailbox policy settings, you need to use the Exchange Online PowerShell.

1. In the EAC, click **Mobile** \> **Mobile Device Mailbox Policies**, and then click **Add** ![Add icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.png).

2. Use the various check boxes and drop-down lists to configure the settings for the mobile device mailbox policy.

   ![New mobile device mailbox policy](../../media/EAC-new-mobile-device-mailbox-policies.png)

    > [!WARNING]
    > Select **This is the default policy** to make the new mobile mailbox policy the default mobile mailbox policy. After you make a mobile mailbox policy the default policy, all new users will be assigned this policy automatically when they are created.

3. Click **Save**.

#### Use the Exchange Online PowerShell to create a new mobile device mailbox policy

You create a new mobile device mailbox policy using the [New-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/new-mobiledevicemailboxpolicy) cmdlet.

1. In the Exchange Online PowerShell, run the following command.

   ```powershell
   New-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy -Name:"Management" -AllowBluetooth:$true -AllowBrowser:$true -AllowCamera:$true -AllowPOPIMAPEmail:$false -PasswordEnabled:$true -AlphanumericPasswordRequired:$true -PasswordRecoveryEnabled:$true -MaxEmailAgeFilter:10 -AllowWiFi:$true -AllowStorageCard:$true -AllowPOPIMAPEmail:$false
   ```

#### How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully created a mobile device mailbox policy, use one of the following options:

1. In the EAC, click **Mobile** \> **Mobile Device mailbox policies**, and verify that your new policy is displayed in the List view.

2. In the Exchange Online PowerShell, run the following command.

   ```powershell
   Get-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy -Identity <PolicyName>
   ```
   
For more information about this cmdlet, see [Get-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-mobiledevicemailboxpolicy).

#### Use the EAC to edit a mobile device mailbox policy

> [!NOTE]
> You can only edit a subset of mobile device mailbox policy settings in the EAC. To edit all the mobile device mailbox policy settings, you need to use the Exchange Online PowerShell.

1. In the EAC, click **Mobile** \> **Mobile Device Mailbox Policies**.

2. Select a policy from the List view and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.png).

3. Use the **General** and **Security** tabs to edit the mobile device mailbox policy settings.

   ![Edit mobile device mailbox policy - General tab](../../media/EAC-edit-mobile-device-mailbox-policies-general.png)
     
   ![Edit mobile device mailbox policy - Security tab](../../media/EAC-edit-mobile-device-mailbox-policies-security.png)

4. Click **Save** to update the policy.

#### Use the Exchange Online PowerShell to edit mobile device mailbox policy settings

You edit a mobile device mailbox policy using the [Set-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-mobiledevicemailboxpolicy) cmdlet.

```powershell
Set-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy -Identity:Default -DevicePasswordEnabled:$true -AlphanumericDevicePasswordRequired:$true -PasswordRecoveryEnabled:$true -MaxEmailAgeFilter:ThreeDays -AllowWiFi:$false -AllowStorageCard:$true -AllowPOPIMAPEmail:$false -IsDefault:$true -AllowTextMessaging:$true -Confirm:$true
```

#### How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully edited a mobile device mailbox policy, do one of the following:

1. In the EAC, click **Mobile** \> **Mobile Device Mailbox Policy**, and then choose a specific policy. In the Details pane, you'll see a number of the policy settings listed.

2. In the Shell, run the following command.

   ```powershell
   Get-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy -Identity <PolicyName>
   ```

For more information about this cmdlet, see [Get-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-mobiledevicemailboxpolicy).
