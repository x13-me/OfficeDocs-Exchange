# Remove an Outlook on the web mailbox policy from Exchange Online

You can remove a Microsoft Outlook on the web mailbox policy from an Exchange organization by using either the Exchange admin center (EAC) or Exchange Online PowerShell.

2. In the confirmation window that appears, click **Yes** to remove the mailbox policy, or click **No** to cancel.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to remove an Outlook on the web mailbox policy

To remove an Outlook on the web mailbox policy, use the following syntax:
