## Use the EAC to create an Outlook on the web mailbox policy

1. In the EAC, go to **Permissions** \> **Outlook Web App policies**, and click **New** ![New icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.png)

2. In the new policy window that opens, configure the following settings:

  - **Policy name**: Enter a unique name for your policy.

  - Use the check boxes to enable or disable features. By default, the most common features are displayed. To see all features that can be enabled or disabled, click **More options**.

    **Note**: You can configure settings for individual users by using the **Set-CASMailbox** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell.

5. Click **Save** to save the policy.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to create an Outlook on the web mailbox policy

In Exchange Online PowerShell, creating an Outlook on the web mailbox policy is a two-step process:

1. Create the policy by using the following syntax:

    ```
    New-OwaMailboxPolicy -Name "<Unique Name>"
    ```

    This example creates an Outlook on the web mailbox policy named Executives.

    ```
    New-OwaMailboxPolicy -Name Policy1
    ```

    For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-OwaMailboxPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/b2e46c22-7e99-4d04-b5ef-81ef64bf7445.aspx).

2. Modify the default settings of the policy.

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully created an Outlook Web App mailbox policy:

- In the EAC, click **Permissions** \> **Outlook Web App Policies**, and look for your new mailbox policy.

To verify that you've successfully created an Outlook on the web mailbox policy, do either of the following steps:

- In the EAC, click **Permissions** \> **Outlook Web App Policies**, and verify the policy is listed. You can select the policy and click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.png) to verify the properties of the policy.

- In Exchange Online PowerShell, run the following command to verify the policy is listed:

    ```
    Get-OwaMailboxPolicy | Format-Table Name
    ```

- In Exchange Online PowerShell, replace \<Policy Name\> with the name of the policy, and run the following command to verify the settings:

    ```
    Get-OwaMailboxPolicy -Identity "<Policy Name>"
    ```
