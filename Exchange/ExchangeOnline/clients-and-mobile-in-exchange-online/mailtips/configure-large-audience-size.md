## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure the large audience size for your organization

You use the **Set-OrganizationConfig** cmdlet to configure the large audience size for your organization. When the sender adds a distribution group that has more members than the configured large audience size, they are shown the Large Audience MailTip. The large audience size is set to 25 by default. This example configures the large audience size to 50 in your organization.

```Set-OrganizationConfig
Set-OrganizationConfig -MailTipsLargeAudienceThreshold 50
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [set-OrganizationConfig](/powershell/module/exchange/set-organizationconfig).
