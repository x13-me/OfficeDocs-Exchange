# Deploying Outlook for iOS and Android app configuration settings

 **Summary**: How to customize the behavior of Outlook for iOS and Android in your Exchange organization.

Outlook for iOS and Android supports app settings that allow unified endpoint management (UEM) administrators (using tools such as Microsoft Endpoint Manager) and Microsoft 365 or Office 365 administrators to customize the behavior of the app.

App configuration can be delivered either through the mobile device management OS channel on enrolled devices ([Managed App Configuration](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/sc2279/Introduction/Intro.html) channel for iOS or the [Android in the Enterprise](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations) channel for Android) or through the Intune App Protection Policy (APP) channel. Outlook for iOS and Android supports the following configuration scenarios:

- Account setup configuration
- Organization allowed accounts mode
- General app configuration settings
- S/MIME settings
- Data protection settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For configuration scenarios that require device enrollment on Android, the devices must be enrolled in Android Enterprise and Outlook for Android must be deployed via the managed Google Play store. For more information, please see [Set up enrollment of Android work profile devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/android-work-profile-enroll) and [Add app configuration policies for managed Android devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/app-configuration-policies-use-android).

Each configuration scenario highlights its specific requirements. For example, whether the configuration scenario requires device enrollment, and thus works with any UEM provider, or requires Intune App Protection Policies. The following flow chart outlines which channel needs to be used for the above configuration scenarios:

> [!NOTE]
> With Microsoft Endpoint Manager, app configuration delivered through the mobile device management OS channel is referred to as a **Managed Devices** App Configuration Policy (ACP); app configuration delivered through the App Protection Policy channel is referred to as a **Managed Apps** App Configuration Policy.

![Flowchart of the process](../../media/acp_flowchart.png)

## Account configuration scenarios

Outlook for iOS and Android offers administrators the following app configuration scenarios with enrolled devices:

  - Account setup configuration
  - Organization allowed accounts mode
  
These configuration scenarios only work with enrolled devices. However, any UEM provider is supported. If you are not using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you need to consult with your UEM documentation on how to deploy these settings. For more information on the configuration keys, see [Configuration keys](#configuration-keys).

### Account setup configuration settings

Outlook for iOS and Android offers administrators the ability to "push" account configurations to their Office 365 and on-premises users leveraging hybrid Modern Authentication users. For more information on account setup configuration, see [Account setup with modern authentication in Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/setup-with-modern-authentication#account-setup-configuration-via-enterprise-mobility-management).

### Organization allowed accounts mode settings

Outlook for iOS and Android offers administrators the ability to restrict email and storage provider accounts to only corporate accounts. For more information on organization allowed accounts mode, please see [Account setup with modern authentication in Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/setup-with-modern-authentication#organization-allowed-accounts-mode).

## General app configuration scenarios

Outlook for iOS and Android offers administrators the ability to customize the default configuration for several in-app settings. This capability is offered for both enrolled devices via any UEM provider and for devices that are not enrolled when Outlook for iOS and Android has an Intune App Protection Policy applied.

> [!NOTE]
> If an App Protection Policy is targeted to the users, the recommendation is to deploy the general app configuration settings in a **Managed Apps** device enrollment model. This ensures the App Configuration Policy is deployed to both enrolled devices and unenrolled devices. 

Outlook supports the following settings for configuration:

Settings that are security-related in nature have an additional option, **Allow user to change setting**. For these settings (*Save Contacts*, *Block external images*, and *Require Biometrics to access the app*), organizations can prevent the user from changing the app's configuration. The organization's configuration cannot be overridden.

**Allow user to change setting** does not change the app's behavior. For example, if the admin enables *Block external images* and prevents user change, then by default external images are not downloaded in messages; however, the user can manually download the images for that message body.

The following conditions describe Outlook's behavior when implementing various app configurations:

  - If the admin configures a setting with its default value, and the app is configured with the default, then the admin's configuration doesn't have any effect. For example, if the admin sets *External recipients MailTip*=on, the default value is also on, so Outlook's configuration doesn't change.

  - If the admin configures a setting with the non-default value and the app is configured with the default, then the admin's configuration is applied. For example, the admin sets *Focused Inbox*=off, but app default is on, so Outlook's configuration for Focused Inbox is off.

  - If the user has configured a non-default value, but the admin has configured a default value and allows user choice, then Outlook retains the user's configured value. For example, the user has enabled contact synchronization, but the admin sets *Save Contacts*=off and allows user choice, so Outlook keeps contact synchronization on and does not break caller-ID for user.

  - If the admin disables user choice, Outlook always enforces the admin-defined configuration, regardless of the user's configuration or default app configuration. For example, the user has enabled contact synchronization, but the admin sets *Save Contacts*=off and disables user choice, so contact synchronization gets disabled and the user is prevented from enabling it.

  - If after the app configuration is applied, if the user changes the setting value to not match the admin desired value (and user choice is allowed), then the user's configuration is retained. For example, block external images is off by default, admin set *Block external images*=on, but afterwards, user changes block external images back to off. In this scenario, block external images remains off the next time the policy is applied.

Users are alerted to configuration changes via a notification toast in the app:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![notification toast in the app](../../media/outlook_mobile_Intune_1.png)

This notification toast will automatically dismiss after 10 seconds. There are two scenarios where this notification toast will not appear:

  - If the app has previously shown the notification in the last hour.

  - If the app has been installed in less than 24 hours.

#### Save Contacts

The *Save Contacts* setting is a special case scenario because unlike the other settings, this setting requires user interaction: the user needs to grant Outlook permissions to access the native Contacts app and the data stored within. If the user does not grant access, then contact synchronization cannot be enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> With Android Enterprise, administrators can configure the default permissions assigned to the managed app. Within the policy, you can define that Outlook for Android is granted READ\_CONTACTS and WRITE\_CONTACTS within the work profile; for more information on how to assign permissions, please see [Add app configuration policies for managed Android devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/app-configuration-policies-use-android). When assigning default permissions it is important to understand which [Android Enterprise deployment models](https://developers.google.com/android/work/overview) are in use, as the permissions may grant access to personal data.
> 
> When enabling Outlook for Android's Save Contacts within Android Enterprise's work profile, Outlook for Android is limited in only being able to access the native Contacts app within the work profile context; this provides a clear separation between work and personal profile data. However, Android Enterprise allows for the dialer and messaging apps within the personal profile to access the local contacts within the work profile. This behavior is enabled by default, but can be controlled via device restrictions; for more information, see [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/device-restrictions-android-for-work). It's possible that some dialer or messaging apps, whether pre-installed by the device manufacturer or installed from the Play Store, do not properly support this capability.

The workflow for enabling Save Contacts is the same for new accounts and existing accounts.

1. The user is notified that the administrator has enabled contact synchronization. In Outlook for iOS, the notification occurs within the app, whereas in Outlook for Android, a persistent notification is delivered via the Android notification center.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Contact sync notification](../../media/outlook_mobile_intune_2.png)

2. If the user taps on the notification, the user is prompted to grant access:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![user is prompted for access to contacts](../../media/outlook_mobile_intune_3.png)

3. If the user allows Outlook to access the native Contacts app, access is granted and contact synchronization is enabled. If the user denies Outlook access to the native Contacts app, then the user is prompted to go into the OS settings and enable contact synchronization:
   
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![user is prompted to allow Outlook to access the native Contacts app](../../media/outlook_mobile_intune_4.png)

4. In the event the user denies Outlook access to the native Contacts app and dismisses the previous prompt, the user may later enable access by navigating to the account configuration within Outlook and tapping **Open Settings**:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Outlook account settings](../../media/outlook_mobile_intune_5.png)

#### Calendar Sync

> [!NOTE]
> Calendar sync support will begin rolling out in October 2020.

Calendar sync enables users to synchronize their Outlook for Android calendar data with the native Android Calendar app. Calendar sync is off by default and requires user participation.

Like *Save Contacts*, the *Sync Calendars* setting is another special case scenario because this setting requires user interaction: the user needs to grant Outlook permissions to access the native Calendar app and the data stored within. If the user does not grant access, then calendar synchronization cannot be enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> With Android Enterprise, administrators can configure the default permissions assigned to the managed app. Within the policy, you can define that Outlook for Android is granted READ\_CALENDAR and WRITE\_CALENDAR within the work profile; for more information on how to assign permissions, please see [Add app configuration policies for managed Android devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/app-configuration-policies-use-android). When assigning default permissions it is important to understand which [Android Enterprise deployment models](https://developers.google.com/android/work/overview) are in use, as the permissions may grant access to personal data. <br/><br/> When enabling Outlook for Android's Sync Calendar within Android Enterprise's work profile, Outlook for Android is limited in only being able to access the native Calendar app within the work profile context; this provides a clear separation between work and personal profile data.

Organizations have several controls for managing *Sync Calendars* with the work or school account:

- With Intune App Protection Policies, the setting **Sync policy managed app data with native apps** defines whether *Save Contacts* and *Sync Calendars* are available for use within the work or school account. By default, this setting is set to **Allow**. If this setting is set to **Blocked**, both *Save Contacts* and *Sync Calendars* are disabled for the work or school account.

- Independent of the Intune App Protection Policy setting **Sync policy managed app data with native apps**, organizations can choose to define the availability of *Sync Calendars* through a managed apps App Configuration Policy. This allows for feature granularity control from a data protection perspective; for example, organizations can enable *Save Contacts* (by setting **Sync policy managed app data with native apps** to **Allow**) but disable *Sync Calendars* (by setting the **Allow Calendar Sync** setting within a managed apps App Configuration Policy to **Off**).

- Finally, if organizations allow the availability of *Sync Calendars*, through an App Configuration Policy, organizations can define the default sync state of the setting. This setting removes the need for the user to enable calendar synchronization.

## S/MIME scenarios

On enrolled devices, Outlook for iOS and Android supports automated certificate delivery. Outlook for iOS and Android also supports app configuration settings that enable or disable S/MIME in the app, as well as the user's ability to change the setting. For more information on how to deploy these settings via Microsoft Endpoint Manager, see [Understanding S/MIME](sensitive-labeling-and-protection-outlook-for-ios-android.md#understanding-smime). For more information on the configuration keys, see [Configuration keys](#configuration-keys).

## Data protection scenarios

Outlook for iOS and Android supports app configuration policies for the following data protection settings when the app is managed by Microsoft Endpoint Manager with an Intune App Protection Policy applied:

- Managing the use of wearable technology

- Managing sensitive data in mail and calendar reminder notifications

- Managing the contact fields synchronized to the native contacts app

- Managing calendar sync availability

These settings can be deployed to the app regardless of device enrollment status. For more information on the configuration keys, see [Configuration keys](#configuration-keys).

### Configure Wearables for Outlook for iOS and Android

By default, Outlook for iOS and Android supports wearable technology, allowing the user to receive message notifications and event reminders, and the ability to interact with messages and view daily calendars. Organizations that want to disable the ability to access corporate data on wearables can block wearables with an App Configuration Policy.

### Configure Notifications for Outlook for iOS and Android

Mobile app notifications are critical in alerting users of new content or reminding them to act. Users interact with these notifications via the lock screen and in the operating system's notification center. Notifications often include detailed information, which can be sensitive in nature. This information, unfortunately, can inadvertently be leaked to casual observers.

Outlook for iOS and Android has designed its notifications to enable users to triage email and alert users to upcoming meetings, including incorporating Time to Leave suggestions. Mail notifications include the sender's address, the subject of the message, and a short message preview of the message body. Calendar reminders include the subject, location, and start time of the meeting.

Recognizing that these notifications may include sensitive data, organizations can leverage an Intune App Protection Policy setting, **Org Data Notifications**, to remove the sensitive data. As this is an App Protection Policy setting, it applies on all devices (phones, tablets, and wearables) for the user for the apps that support the setting. For more information on the setting, see [iOS App Protection Policy settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios) and [Android App Protection Policy settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android).

In addition to the App Protection Policy setting, Outlook for iOS and Android has a data protection App Configuration Policy setting, **Calendar Notifications**, that provides additional flexibility with calendar notifications – organizations can block sensitive information in mail notifications, while allowing sensitive information in calendar notifications. After all, users might just need to know where they are going and when they should leave, at a glance. 

The following table outlines the notification experience in Outlook for iOS and Android based on the combination of the App Protection and App Configuration policy settings:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Org Data Notifications value</th>
<th>Calendar Notifications value</th>
<th>Notification behavior</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Allow (default)</td>
<td>Not Configured (default)</td>
<td>Default client behavior where sensitive data is exposed in mail and calendar notifications</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Block</td>
<td>Not Configured</td>
<td>Sensitive data is exposed in mail and calendar notifications as Outlook ignores the block setting</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Block Org Data</td>
<td>Not Configured</td>
<td>Sensitive data is not available in mail or calendar notifications</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Block Org Data</td>
<td>Allowed</td>
<td><p>Sensitive data is not available in mail notifications</p><p>Calendar notifications expose sensitive data</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Configure Contact Field Sync to native Contacts for Outlook for iOS and Android

The settings allow organizations to control the contact fields that synchronize between Outlook on iOS and Android and the native Contacts apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Outlook for Android supports bi-directional contact synchronization. However, if a user edits a field in the native contacts app that is restricted (such as the **Notes** field), then that data will not synchronize back into Outlook for Android.

### Configure Calendar Sync availability with Outlook for Android

Calendar sync enables users to synchronize their Outlook for Android calendar data with the native Android Calendar app. This setting allows organizations to control whether calendar sync is available to the work or school account.

## Deploying configuration scenarios with Microsoft Endpoint Manager for enrolled devices

Microsoft Endpoint Manager enables administrators to easily deploy these settings to Outlook for iOS and Android via App Configuration Policies.

The following steps allow you to create an app configuration policy. After the configuration policy is created, you can assign its settings to groups of users.

> [!NOTE]
> Intune notifies the enrolled device to check in with the Intune service for policy changes. The notification times vary, including immediately up to a few hours. For more information, please see [Common questions, issues, and resolutions with device policies and profiles in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/device-profile-troubleshoot#how-long-does-it-take-for-devices-to-get-a-policy-profile-or-app-after-they-are-assigned). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When deploying app configuration policies to managed devices, issues can occur when multiple policies have different values for the same configuration key and are targeted for the same app and user. This is due to the lack of a conflict resolution mechanism for resolving the differing values. You can prevent this by ensuring that only a single app configuration policy for managed devices is defined and targeted for the same app and user.

### Create a managed devices app configuration policy for Outlook for iOS and Android

1. Sign into [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).

2. Select **Apps** and then select **App configuration policies**.

3. On the **App Configuration policies** blade, choose **Add** and select **Managed devices** to start the app configuration policy creation flow.

4. On the **Basics** section, enter a **Name**, and optional **Description** for the app configuration settings.

5. For **Platform**, choose either **iOS/iPadOS** or **Android Enterprise**.

6. If Android Enterprise is selected as the platform, for **Profile Type**, choose **All Profile Types**.

7. For **Targeted app**, choose **Select app**, and then, on the **Associated app** blade, choose **Microsoft Outlook**. Click **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If Outlook is not listed as an available app, then you must add it by following the instructions in [Assign apps to Android work profile devices with Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/apps-add-android-for-work) and [Add iOS store apps to Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/store-apps-ios).

8. Click **Next** to complete the basic settings of the app configuration policy.

9. On the **Settings** section, select **Use configuration designer** for the **Configuration settings format**.

10. If you want to deploy account setup configuration, select **Yes** for **Configure email account** **settings** and configure appropriately:

      > [!NOTE]
      > If an App Protection Policy is targeted to the users, the recommendation is to deploy the general app configuration settings in a **Managed Apps** device enrollment model instead of using **Managed devices**. This ensures the App Configuration Policy is deployed to both enrolled devices and unenrolled devices. 

    - For **Authentication type**, select **Modern authentication**. This is required for Microsoft 365 or Office 365 accounts or on-premises accounts leveraging hybrid modern authentication.

    - For **Username attribute from AAD**, select **User Principal Name**.

    - For **Email address attribute from AAD**, select **Primary SMTP Address**.

    - If you want to configure Outlook for iOS and Android such that only the work or school account can be used, select **Require** for **Allow only work or** **school** **accounts**. Please note that this configuration will only allow a single corporate account to be added to Outlook for iOS and Android.

11. If you want to deploy general app configuration settings, configure the desired settings accordingly:

    - For **Focused Inbox**, choose from the available options: **Not configured** (default), **On** (app default), **Off**.

    - For **Require Biometrics to access the app**, choose from the available options: **Not configured** (default), **On**, **Off** (app default). When selecting **On** or **Off**, administrators can choose to allow the user to change the app setting's value. Select **Yes** (app default) to allow the user to change the setting or choose **No** if you want to prevent the user from changing the setting's value. This setting is only available in Outlook for iOS.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > If the account is protected by an Intune App Protection Policy that requires a PIN to access the protected account, then the **Require Biometrics to access the app** setting should be disabled, otherwise the user is prompted with multiple authentication prompts when accessing the app.

    - For **Save Contacts**, choose from the available options: **Not configured** (default), **On**, **Off** (app default). When selecting **On** or **Off**, administrators can choose to allow the user to change the app setting's value. Select **Yes** (app default) to allow the user to change the setting or choose **No** if you want to prevent the user from changing the setting's value.

    - For **Suggested Replies**, choose from the available options: **Not configured** (default), **On** (app default), **Off**. When selecting **On** or **Off**, administrators can choose to allow the user to change the app setting's value. Select **Yes** (app default) to allow the user to change the setting or choose **No** if you want to prevent the user from changing the setting's value.

    - For **Recommendations feed**, choose from the available options: **Not configured** (default), **On** (app default), **Off**.

    - For **External recipients MailTip**, choose from the available options: **Not configured** (default), **On** (app default), **Off**.

14. On the **Assignments** section, choose **Select groups to include**. Select the Azure AD group to which you want to assign the app configuration policy, and then choose **Select**.

15. When you are finished with assignments, choose **Next**.

16. On the **Review + Create** section, review the settings configured and choose **Create**.

The newly created configuration policy is displayed on the **App configuration** blade.

> [!NOTE]
> For **Managed devices** you will need to create a separate app configuration policy for each platform. Also, Outlook will need to be installed from the Company Portal for the configuration settings to take effect.

## Deploying configuration scenarios with Microsoft Endpoint Manager for unenrolled devices

If you are using Microsoft Endpoint Manager as your mobile app management provider, the following steps allow you to create a managed apps app configuration policy. After the configuration is created, you can assign its settings to groups of users.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Endpoint Manager managed apps will check-in with an interval of 30 minutes for Intune App Configuration Policy status, when deployed in conjunction with an Intune App Protection Policy. If an Intune App Protection Policy isn't assigned to the user, then the Intune App Configuration Policy check-in interval is set to 720 minutes.

### Create a managed apps app configuration policy for Outlook for iOS and Android

1. Sign into [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).

2. Select **Apps** and then select **App configuration policies**.

3. On the **App Configuration policies** blade, choose **Add** and select **Managed apps**.

4. On the **Basics** section, enter a **Name**, and optional **Description** for the app configuration settings.

5. For **Public apps**, choose **Select public apps**, and then, on the **Targeted apps** blade, choose **Outlook** by selecting both the iOS and Android platform apps. Click **Select** to save the selected public apps.

6. Click **Next** to complete the basic settings of the app configuration policy.

7. On the **Settings** section, expand the **Outlook configuration settings**.

8. If you want to deploy general app configuration settings, configure the desired settings accordingly:

    - For **Focused Inbox**, choose from the available options: **Not configured** (default), **Yes** (app default), **No**.

    - For **Require Biometrics to access the app**, choose from the available options: **Not configured** (default), **Yes**, **No** (app default). When selecting **Yes** or **No**, administrators can choose to allow the user to change the app setting's value. Select **Yes** (app default) to allow the user to change the setting or choose **No** if you want to prevent the user from changing the setting's value. This setting is only available in Outlook for iOS.

      > [!IMPORTANT]

## Configuration keys
The following sections outline the app configuration keys and their supported values. Configuration keys identified with the **Managed apps** device enrollment type are delivered through the App Protection Policy channel. Configuration keys identified with the **Managed devices** device enrollment type are delivered through the mobile device management OS channel. If a configuration key is listed with both device enrollment types, the key can be delivered through either channel; for more information see [General app configuration scenarios](#general-app-configuration-scenarios).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App configuration keys are case sensitive. Use the proper casing to ensure the configuration takes affect.

### iOS devices and third-party unified endpoint management solutions
If the **Managed devices** device enrollment type configuration keys are deployed with a third-party unified endpoint management (UEM) provider, then the following additional key must also be delivered for iOS devices:

   **key** = IntuneMAMUPN, **value** = <username@company.com>

The exact syntax of the key/value pair may differ based on the third-party UEM provider used. The following table shows examples of some third-party UEM providers and the exact values for the key/value pair:

   |Third-party UEM provider| Configuration Key | Value Type | Configuration Value|
