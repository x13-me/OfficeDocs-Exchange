# Create and manage groups in the new Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

Use the new Exchange admin center (EAC) to create, modify, export, or remove groups in your Exchange Online organization.

There are four types of groups that can be used to distribute messages:

- **Microsoft 365 group** (formerly known as Office 365 groups), is used for collaboration between teams, both inside and outside your company; by giving them a group email and a shared workspace for conversations, files, and calendars.

  >[!NOTE]
  > **Microsoft 365 group** is the recommended group as it provides the teams a shared workspace to communicate, share files, appointments, emails, contacts and other mailbox items.

- **Distribution list group** is used for sending emails/notifications to a group of people.

- **Dynamic distribution list group** is used to expedite the mass sending of email messages and other information within a Microsoft Exchange organization.

- **Mail-enabled security group** is used for granting access to resources such as OneDrive, SharePoint, and emailing notifications to those users.
