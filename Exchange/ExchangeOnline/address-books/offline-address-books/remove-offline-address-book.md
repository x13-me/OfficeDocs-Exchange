# Remove an offline address book in Exchange Online

This topic explains how to remove an offline address book (OAB) from Exchange Online. If you remove the default OAB, you must assign a different OAB as the default OAB. For instructions about how to change the default OAB, see [Change the default offline address book](change-default-offline-address-book.md).

For additional management tasks related to OABs, see [Offline address book procedures](offline-address-book-procedures.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 5 minutes.

- By default, the Address List role isn't assigned to any role groups in Exchange Online. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see [Modify role groups](../../permissions-exo/role-groups.md#modify-role-groups).

- You can only use Exchange Online PowerShell to perform the procedures in this topic. To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

> [!TIP]
> Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Online](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/msonline/home?forum=onlineservicesexchange) or [Exchange Online Protection](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/forefront/home?forum=FOPE).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to remove an OAB

This example removes an OAB named My OAB.

```PowerShell
Remove-OfflineAddressBook -Identity "My OAB"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Remove-OfflineAddressBook](/powershell/module/exchange/remove-offlineaddressbook).


## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully removed the OAB, run the following command to verify that the OAB is gone.

```PowerShell
Get-OfflineAddressBook
```
