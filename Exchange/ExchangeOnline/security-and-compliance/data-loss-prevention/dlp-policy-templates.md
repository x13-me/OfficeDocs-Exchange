# DLP policy templates supplied in Exchange

In Microsoft Exchange Server and Exchange Online, you can use data loss prevention (DLP) policy templates as a starting point for building DLP policies that help you meet your specific regulatory and business policy needs. You can modify the templates to meet the specific needs of your organization.

> [!CAUTION]
> You should enable your DLP policies in test mode before running them in your production environment. During such tests, it is recommended that you configure sample user mailboxes and send test messages that invoke your test policies in order to confirm the results. > Use of these policies does not ensure compliance with any regulation. After your testing is complete, make the necessary configuration changes in Exchange so the transmission of information complies with your organization's policies. For example, you might need to configure TLS with known business partners or add more restrictive mail flow rule (also known as transport rule) actions, such as adding rights protection to messages that contain a certain type of data.
