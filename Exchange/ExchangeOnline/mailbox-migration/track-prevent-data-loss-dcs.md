# Track and prevent migration data loss

When migrating to Exchange Online, the migration process might reveal inconsistencies that pose a risk of data loss. Such inconsistencies can occur during almost any migration, whether from on-premises Exchange Server, Public Folders, PST file imports, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), or third-party IMAP servers. The migration process tracks and reports on any possible instances of data loss by generating a **DataConsistencyScore**.

## Migration and DataConsistencyScore

When you attempt a migration, any inconsistencies between the source and target data stores will count towards the DataConsistencyScore. This score is then used to determine whether an Exchange Online migration will complete successfully or if intervention is needed.

There are 4 possible grades that are derived from the DataConsistencyScore.

|Grade|Description|
|---|---|
|**Perfect**| No inconsistencies noted during migration. The migration will succeed.|
|**Good**| At least 1 inconsistency noted, but the data loss was not impactful. For example, if only metadata or folder permissions were lost during migration. The migration will succeed.|
|**Investigate**|A small amount of significant data loss was detected, caused by some common inconsistency types. You must approve the migration for it to complete.|
|**Poor**|Major data loss was detected. The migration cannot complete unless you contact Microsoft Support for assistance.|

You can view the DataConsistencyScore for your migration in the classic Exchange admin center at a per-user and per-batch level. You can also find it using PowerShell cmdlets; the *DataConsistencyScore* property exists on **MigrationBatch**, **MigrationUser**, and **RequestStatistics** objects.

## How the DataConsistencyScore is calculated

There are various thresholds used to determine the DataConsistencyScore. Microsoft is constantly tuning these thresholds to ensure that problematic data loss does not occur during migrations. The details of these thresholds are not presented to Exchange Online administrators.

For batches, the DataConsistencyScore is equal to the worst DataConsistencyScore of any user within that batch. This behavior helps administrators know immediately whether there is any data loss that should be investigated.

## Guidance for grades of Investigate or Poor

If the migration receives a grade of **Investigate**, then you can approve skipped items manually to allow the migration to succeed.

If you are using batches, then run:

```PowerShell
Set-MigrationBatch -ApproveSkippedItems or Set-MigrationUser -ApproveSkippedItems
```

If you are using MoveRequests directly, then run:

```PowerShell
Set-MoveRequest -SkippedItemApprovalTime $([DateTime]::UtcNow)
```

For a batch scored as **Investigate**, approving the migration allows you to complete all migrations in the batch with a score of Perfect, Good, or Investigate.

For a batch scored as **Poor**, approving the migration allows you to complete all migrations in the batch with a score of Perfect, Good, or Investigate, but will not approve any migration in the batch with a score of Poor.

If the migration fails with a grade of **Poor**, you cannot force the migration to succeed. Please contact Microsoft Support for assistance.

## How to opt in or opt out of using DataConsistencyScore

Through the end of 2020, the [BadItemLimit and LargeItemLimit parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/new-moverequest) will remain available as options. You can specify a value for the *BadItemLimit* and *LargeItemLimit* parameters when using cmdlets or you can fill in the BadItemLimit or LargeItemLimit box in the EAC UI. When you specify a BadItemLimit or LargeItemLimit, the old migration method is used and the DataConsistencyScore is not calculated.

If neither the *BadItemLimit* parameter nor the *LargeItemLimit* parameter is specified, or if the boxes in the classic Exchange admin center wizard are left blank, then the new migration method and DataConsistencyScore are used.

> [!NOTE]
> The BadItemLimit and LargeItemLimit parameters will be completely replaced by DataConsistencyScore in January 2021.
