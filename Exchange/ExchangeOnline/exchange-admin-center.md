# Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

You use the Exchange admin center to manage email settings for your organization.

## Get to the Exchange admin center

You must have [Office 365 admin permissions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=255444) to access the Exchange admin center.

1. [Sign in](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=529144) to Office 365 using your work or school account, and then choose the **Admin** tile.

2. In the Office 365 admin center, choose **Admin centers** \> **Exchange**.

You can also get to the Exchange admin center directly by using a URL. To do this, go to [https://outlook.office365.com/ecp](https://outlook.office365.com/ecp) and sign in using your credentials.

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to use a private browsing session (not a regular session) to access the Exchange admin center using the direct URL. This will prevent the credential that you are currently logged on with from being used. To open an InPrivate Browsing session in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer or a Private Browsing session in Mozilla FireFox, press CTRL+SHIFT+P. To open a private browsing session in Google Chrome (called an incognito window), press CTRL+SHIFT+N.

### List view

When you select a tab, in most cases you'll see a list view. The list view in Exchange admin center is designed to remove limitations that existed in Exchange Control Panel.

In Exchange Online, the viewable limit from within the Exchange admin center list view is approximately 10,000 objects. In addition, paging is included so you can page to the results. In the **Recipients** list view, you can also configure page size and export the data to a CSV file.

### Details pane

When you select an item from the list view, information about that object is displayed in the details pane.

 **To bulk edit several items**: press the CTRL key, select the objects you want to bulk edit, and use the options in the details pane.

### Centers, Me tile, and Help

The Centers tile allows you to change from one admin center to another. The Me tile allows you to sign out of the EAC and sign in as a different user. From the Help ![Help Icon](media/ITPro_EAC_HelpIcon.gif) drop-down menu, you can perform the following actions:

- **Help**: Click ![Help Icon](media/ITPro_EAC_HelpIcon.gif) to view the online help content.

- **Disable Help bubble**: The Help bubble displays contextual help for fields when you create or edit and object. You can turn off the Help bubble help or turn it on if it has been disabled.
