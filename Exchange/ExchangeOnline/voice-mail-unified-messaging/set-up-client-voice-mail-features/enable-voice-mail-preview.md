# Enable Voice Mail Preview for users in Exchange Online

> [!NOTE]
> Cloud Voicemail takes the place of Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) in providing voice messaging functionality for Skype for Business 2019 voice users who have mailboxes on Exchange Server 2019 or Exchange Online, and for Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business Online voice users. For more information, see [Plan Cloud Voicemail service](/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-cloud-voicemail) and [Retiring Unified Messaging in Exchange Online](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Exchange-Team-Blog/Retiring-Unified-Messaging-in-Exchange-Online/ba-p/608991).

You can enable the Voice Mail Preview feature for users associated with a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy if it has been disabled. Enabling this setting allows users to receive the text of a voice mail message in the message body of an email or text message. The default setting is enabled.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/um-mailbox-policy-procedures.md).
