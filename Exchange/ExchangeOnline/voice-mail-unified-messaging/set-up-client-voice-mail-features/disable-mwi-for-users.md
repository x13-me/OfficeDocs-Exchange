# Disable Message Waiting Indicator (MWI) for users in Exchange Online

You can enable or disable Message Waiting Indicator for users associated with a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. Message Waiting Indicator is a feature found in most legacy voice mail systems. In its most common form, it lights a lamp on a voice mail subscriber's phone to indicate the presence of a new voice mail message. Message Waiting Indicator can also send a text message to a UM-enabled user's mobile phone. The default setting is enabled.

If Message Waiting Indicator is disabled on the UM IP gateway, the feature isn't available to UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/um-mailbox-policy-procedures.md).
