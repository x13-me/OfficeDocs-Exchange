## Use the EAC to enable callers to send voice messages or prevent them from doing so

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **UM dial plans**. In the list view, select the UM dial plan you want to change, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

2. On the **UM Dial Plan** page, under **UM Auto Attendants**, select the UM auto attendant you want to manage, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM Auto Attendant** page \> **Address book and operator access**, under **Options for contacting users**, select the check box next to **Allow callers to leave voice messages for users** to enable callers to leave voice messages. To prevent callers from leaving voice messages, clear the check box.

4. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you disable this option and also disable the **Allow callers to dial users** option, the **Options for searching the address book** are also disabled.
