# Configure the maximum recording duration

You can specify the maximum number of minutes allowed for each voice recording when a caller leaves a voice mail message. This value can be set to a number from 1 through 100. For most organizations, this value should be set to the default of 20 minutes. Setting this value too low can cause long voice messages to be disconnected before they're completed. Setting this value too high lets users save lengthy voice messages in their Inboxes.

This setting is important if you've implemented strict disk quotas for users. It must be set to a lower value than the one set for **Maximum call duration (minutes)**.

For additional tasks related to UM dial plans, see [UM Dial Plan Procedures](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/1bda77c8-c4e2-4ae0-a001-76ae029bf843.aspx).
