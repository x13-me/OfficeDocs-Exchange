# Use a screen reader to manage anti-spam protection in Exchange Online

Exchange Online includes spam filtering capabilities that help protect your network from spam transferred through email. Administrators do not need to set up or maintain these filtering technologies, which are enabled by default. However, administrators can make company-specific filtering customizations in the Exchange admin center (EAC)—all using a screen reader and keyboard shortcuts.
