# Restore deleted items from public folder

The items deleted from public folders are stored in the recoverable items (dumpster) of public folder until the retention period is over.

## Permissions required

The user restoring items from the public folder must have atleast the `Author` public folder client permission assigned. For more information on public folder client permissions, see [Add-PublicFolderClientPermission](/powershell/module/exchange/add-publicfolderclientpermission).

## Restore deleted items

1. In outlook, under **Public Folders**, select the folder from which items were deleted, and click **Recover Deleted Items**.
