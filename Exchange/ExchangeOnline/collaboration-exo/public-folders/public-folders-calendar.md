# Create a Public Folder calendar in Exchange Online

A public folder calendar is a good solution for people looking for only a shared calendar without having to maintain an additional mailbox along with it. This article explains how to set up and access public folder calendars in Microsoft Exchange Online.

> [!Important]
> You must use the Microsoft Outlook desktop client to create the public folder calendar.

> [!Note]
> The Calendar type of public folder can be accessed from Outlook Web App and the Outlook desktop client. Public folders, including calendar, cannot be accessed from mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

Before you create your public folder calendar, follow the prerequisites.

1. Ensure public folders are [deployed](./create-public-folder-mailbox.md) in Exchange Online.

2. Use the following command to see a list of any public folder mailboxes present in the organization:

   ```PowerShell
   Get-Mailbox -PublicFolder
   Get-PublicFolder \
   ```

3. If you don't see a list of the public folder mailboxes, then follow the steps to [create a public folder mailbox](./create-public-folder-mailbox.md).

4. Verify that you have the necessary [access rights](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2573274/public-folder-permissions-for-exchange-server) to create the public folder.

   - If you want the user to be able to create a public folder on the root of the public folder hierarchy, along with all other access rights, run the following command:

     ```PowerShell
     Add-PublicFolderClientPermission -Identity "\" -AccessRights Owner -User User1
     ```

   - If you want the user to be able to create a public folder under the existing public folder, such as a folder named Marketing, then run the following command:

     ```PowerShell
      Add-PublicFolderClientPermission -Identity "\Marketing" -AccessRights Editor -User User1
     ```

5. Login to the Outlook desktop client and ensure you're able to access the public folder deployment.
