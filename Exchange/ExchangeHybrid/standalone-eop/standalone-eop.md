# Standalone Exchange Online Protection

Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is the cloud-based filtering service that helps protect your organization against spam and malware. EOP is included in all Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes. For more information, see [Exchange Online Protection overview](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/exchange-online-protection-overview).

However, EOP is also available in the following on-premises scenarios:

- **In a standalone scenario**: EOP provides cloud-based email protection for your on-premises Exchange organization or for any other on-premises SMTP email solution.
- **In a hybrid deployment**: EOP can be configured to protect your on-premises Exchange environment and control mail routing when you have a mix of on-premises and cloud mailboxes. For more information about hybrid, see [Exchange Server hybrid deployments](../exchange-hybrid.md).

In these scenarios, EOP can simplify the management of your email environment and alleviate many of the burdens that come with maintaining on-premises hardware and software.

The EOP articles in this node are specifically targeted for on-premises email and hybrid scenarios.
