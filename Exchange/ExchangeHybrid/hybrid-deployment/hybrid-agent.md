# Microsoft Hybrid Agent – Preview

## Modern Hybrid Connectivity Requirements

### Overview

Hybrid deployment using the Hybrid Agent, aka “Modern Hybrid” has slightly
different connectivity requirements, in that by lowering the bar, it does not
mean that no outbound and inbound connectivity are required. This document aims
to identify specific connectivity requirements for Modern Hybrid deployments.

### Agent

The Hybrid Agent itself has limited inbound or outbound connection requirements,
making it appropriate for installation in a DMZ. However, limited does not mean
“none.” Being built on Azure AD Application Proxy technology, the agent’s core
requirements are no different. These are summed up in the “Open Your Ports”
section in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-enable.

### Stand Alone Hybrid Configuration Wizard (SHCW)

The Stand Alone Hybrid Configuration Wizard is, as its name indicates, a wizard
which guides the process of hybrid configuration. It is capable of downloading
and installing the agent, as well as configuring and validating the endpoints,
but to do so, it requires remote powershell connectivity to the CAS server
selected for the agent endpoint.

Note that as a ClickOnce client, a browser with ClickOnce support such as
Internet Explorer or Edge is required. If your browser supports click-once
activation via a plugin, the SHCW will also work. Once activated, the first step
of the ClickOnce application is either to download its core components (first
install) or check for an upgrade (subsequent installs). After this, it will
perform a number of tests, some of which will require RPC access to the Domain
Controller (credential validation).

A future update will modify these constraints.

### Client Access Server

In a Modern Hybrid Deployment, the inbound request requirements of a CAS server
are mitigated, however, the CAS Server makes outbound free/busy requests for
Hybrid. As such, the CAS server must maintain outbound https and http
connectivity.

### Transport/Edge Transport

Whether you utilize edge transport servers or combined transport servers,
transport servers require both inbound and outbound connections on port 25
(SMTP).

### Considerations for Outbound Proxies

If an environment requires outbound proxy servers, additional configuration and
requirements come into play. This list may not be exhaustive.

### Agent

The agent does support using an outbound proxy, but doing so requires
modifications to the configuration file after installation. Also, a proxy which
prevents registration will result in the connector failing to install. It is
recommended to install allowing the connectors to bypass the proxy until app
config changes can be made.

### Client Access Server (CAS)

The CAS Server’s proxy settings (obtainable from Get-ExchangeServer \| fl
InternetWebProxy) must be set correctly, or outbound free busy may fail. In
fact, the SHCW may not be able to configure delegated auth due to this. Though
the SHCW issues the command to create the federation trust, like most powershell
commands, it is actually executed in the context of the Client Access Server,
and the request to domans.live.com to exchange metadata and establish a trust
will fail if the proxy is not set correctly.

## Agent Install Location & Requirements

The private preview of the Microsoft Hybrid Agent (formally referred to as the
“connector”) can be installed on either a machine specifically designed at the
“proxy server” (preferred for large or complex organizations) or on an Exchange
2010, 2013 or 2016 CAS server (ideal for small or test topologies). The
designated Hybrid Agent server is also supported in the DMZ.

### Requirements

1. The machine hosting the Hybrid Agent install must be able to HTTPS to the
    internet, HTTPS and Remote PowerShell (RPS) to the selected CAS server for hybrid configuration.
2. The machine hosting the Hybrid Agent should be Windows Server 2012 R2 or
    2016, with .NET Framework 4.6.2 installed.
3. The machine where the Hybrid Agent is installed must have either Edge or
    Internet Explorer installed.
4. The machine where the Hybrid Agent is installed must be able to communicate
    with a domain controller to authenticate your on-premises Exchange Org admin
    credentials. This means that you must be domain joined.
5. Installation must be done as an administrator account.
6. TLS 1.0 must be enabled on the machine where the Hybrid Agent is installed.

#### Port specifications

1. Ports to be opened outbound are 443 and 80, as shown here:
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-enable
2. The agent machine must be able to open 443 and 80 to the target CAS server
   (single instance of the agent and single CAS server target during preview).
3. Because SHCW will be running on this machine as well, the agent machine must
    also be able to connect via RPS, which is 5985 and 5986.
4. The agent service supports specific proxy but requires editing the config
    file after installation like any other managed code binary to specify the
    proxy.

## Limitations

The private preview only supports a single Hybrid Agent install for the Exchange
Organization. We are working to support multiple Agent installs for redundancy,
but this is not available yet. If the Hybrid Agent’s server goes offline, free
busy look ups from your tenant to on-premises and mailbox migrations to/from your
tenant will no longer work. If the server hosting the agent is permanently
offline, was rebuilt, or the agent was uninstalled, re-running the Hybrid
Configuration Wizard to reinstall the Hybrid Agent directly on the new server is
the recovery method.

There are two Exchange related flows supported in private preview:

1. Free busy requests from cloud users to on-premises
2. Mailbox migrations to/from cloud

These flows are configured by the Hybrid Configuration Wizard (HCW) in the Organization Relationship and the
Intra Organization Connector object in the cloud, and the Migration Endpoint.

Free busy requests from on-premises users to cloud users do not traverse the
Hybrid Agent. These requests still require your Exchange servers have outbound
connectivity to Office 365 end points.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges
describes the required (and hybrid) ports and IPs outbound from on-prem to the
service.

SMTP does not traverse the Hybrid Agent and will still require a public
certificate for mail flow between Office 365 and on-premises.

MailTips, Message Tracking and Multi-mailbox search do not traverse the Hybrid
Agent. These Hybrid features would require the classic connectivity model where
EWS and Autodiscover are published on-premises and externally available to
office 365.

## Running Setup

The HCW is the application responsible for both
installing and configuring the Hybrid Agent and setting the required
configuration both on-premise and in the tenant to enable our traditional hybrid
feature set (free busy, migrations, mail routing, etc.).

You must run the HCW from the machine where you want the agent installed. After
the Agent is installed and configured, the HCW will locate a preferred server to
connect to and run the standard hybrid configuration steps. You do not have to
run the HCW from the Exchange server directly, but as stated above, the machine
where the HCW is executed from must be able to HTTPS and RPS the selected CAS
server.

### Installation Prerequisites

1. To allow installation of the Hybrid Agent and to be able to perform mailbox
    migrations to/from your tenant, please verify or enable MRS Proxy on the EWS
    virtual directory, e.g.:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-WebServicesVirtualDirectory -Identity "EWS (Default Web Site)" -MRSProxyEnabled $true
    ```
    
2. Go to Programs and Features and verify a previous version of the Microsoft
    Office 365 Hybrid Configuration Wizard is not already installed. If it is,
    uninstall it.
3. .NET Framework version 4.6.2 is required on the machine where the HCW is
    being run. If this version is not already installed, HCW will prompt you to
    install/upgrade.

The Hybrid Agent install option is only available with the use of a hidden setup
switch by executing the HCW application from the following URL:
<https://aka.ms/modernhybrid>

### Installation steps

1. The HCW will open and you can you proceed with setup. *Note*: if a previous
    version of the HCW was already installed on the machine, please uninstall it
    first from Add/Remove Programs. Once the application opens, click next to
    begin setup.
2. The first page will prompt you to select the Exchange server where the
    traditional hybrid setup will be executed against. Either select the default
    server provided by the HCW or specify a specific server in the second radio
    button. Select next.
3. The following page will prompt you to enter your Exchange admin credentials
    and your tenant admin credentials. Select next.
4. The next page will gather configuration and environment details. When it’s
    completed, select next.
5. On the Hybrid Features page, select Full Hybrid Configuration. If you would
    like to also opt for the Organization Configuration Transfer, you can select
    it now, or later. Select next.
6. On the Hybrid Connectivity page, select Use Exchange Modern Hybrid e.g:

    ![](../media/08b9b1933233cf4348506a629d1a6f22.png)

    Select next.
7. This will begin the process to setup and install the Hybrid Agent. There are
    four basic phases:
    1. Downloading the agent install package
    2. Installation of the agent on the local machine (note: this will prompt
        for your MS Online Global Admin credentials again)
    3. Registration of the agent to Azure, including creation of the URL used
        for proxying requests
8. Testing migration viability from your tenant to on-premises via the agent

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Hybrid Agent installation process could take up to 10 minutes to complete all tasks.

    After the Hybrid Agent installation and validation tasks complete, the
    remaining HCW pages and experience will be exactly as they are today.
    During the final configuration application phase of the HCW, we create
    the new migration endpoint with the custom URL and set the
    TargetSharingEPR value on the Organization Relationship and/or the Intra
    Organization Connector. Both the new migration endpoint value and the
    TargetSharingEPR value are set on the tenant or cloud side only as we
    use this new path (URL) to send requests from cloud to on-premises for free
    busy and migrations. On-premises free busy requests for cloud users still
    reach outbound to the internet. You can view the specific values
    configured for each of these by running Get-MigrationEndpoint and
    Get-OrganizationRelationship from the tenant RPS session. E.g.:

### From tenant RPS

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\Hybrid\> Get-MigrationEndpoint | fl Identity,RemoteServerIdentity : Hybrid Migration Endpoint - EWS (Default Web Site)

RemoteServer :
087f1c2e-8711-4176-ab4f-4b1c1777a350.resource.mailboxmigration.his.msappproxy.net

PS C:\Users\Hybrid\> Get-OrganizationRelationship | fl Name,TargetSharingEpr

Name : O365 to On-premises - c6d22e11-2340-4432-9122-19097bacf0c1

TargetSharingEpr :
https://087f1c2e-8711-4176-ab4f-4b1c1777a350.resource.mailboxmigration.his.msappproxy.net/EWS/Exchange.asmx
```

## Testing & validation of the Hybrid Agent

After successful installation of the Hybrid Agent and HCW configurations, the
following are two simple tests to validate free busy and mailbox migration flow
via the Agent.

On the server where the Hybrid Agent is installed, open Perform Monitor. Add the
object, Microsoft AD App Proxy Connector and the \# requests counter to your
view. E.g.:

![](../media/d67d36919447785a56ab2b3759e12e74.png)

### Migration

Open an RPS session to your tenant and run the following test cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Test-MigrationServerAvailability -ExchangeRemoteMove: $true -RemoteServer ‘<your customguid>.resource.mailboxmigration.his.msappproxy.net' -Credentials (Get-Credential)
```

Enter on-premises credential in the pop up. After the test returns the success
result, switch back to your Performance Monitor view and you can see the number
of requests will have incremented up.

Performing a test mailbox move from on-premises to the cloud is also an option.

### Free Busy

The same validation can be performed by logging into a cloud mailbox and
requesting free busy via a test meeting request for a mailbox located on-premises.
