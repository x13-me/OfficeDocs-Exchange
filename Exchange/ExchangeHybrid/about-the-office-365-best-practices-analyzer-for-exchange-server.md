# About the Office 365 Best Practices Analyzer for Exchange Server

The Office 365 Best Practices Analyzer is an automated tool that evaluates the health and readiness of your on-premises Exchange environment. You can run the Office 365 Best Practices Analyzer on your Exchange server at any time to assess the state of your Exchange configuration.

- On-premises Exchange server only (Exchange 2013 or later)

- Hybrid configuration (with Exchange 2013 or later)

You'll need an Office 365 or Azure Active Directory account to install and use the tool. After you've installed and run the tool, you won't be required to sign-in to the Office 365 admin center to re-run the checks (although you might be prompted to sign-in again).
