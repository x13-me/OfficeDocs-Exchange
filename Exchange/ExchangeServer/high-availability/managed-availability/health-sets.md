# Manage health sets and server health in Exchange Server

You can use the built-in health reporting cmdlets to perform a variety of tasks related to managed availability, such as:

- Viewing the health of a server or group of servers

- Viewing a list of health sets

- Viewing a list of probes, monitors, and responders associated with a particular health set

- View a list of monitors and their current health

For more information about health reporting and managed availability, see [Managed availability](managed-availability.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 2 minutes

- The procedures in this topic require the Exchange Management Shell. For more information, see [Open the Exchange Management Shell](/powershell/exchange/open-the-exchange-management-shell).

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](../../about-documentation/exchange-admin-center-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to view server health

You can use the Exchange Management Shell to get a summary of the health of an Exchange server.

Run either of the following commands to view the health sets and health information on an Exchange server:

```powershell
Get-HealthReport -Identity <ServerName>
```

```powershell
Get-ServerHealth -Identity <ServerName> | Format-Table Server,CurrentHealthSetState,Name,HealthSetName,AlertValue,HealthGroupName -Auto
```

Run any of the following commands to view the health sets on an Exchange server or database availability group:

```powershell
Get-ExchangeServer | Get-HealthReport -RollupGroup
```

```powershell
Get-ExchangeServer | Get-HealthReport -RollupGroup -HealthSetName <HealthSet>
```

```powershell
(Get-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup <DAGName>).Servers | Get-HealthReport -RollupGroup
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-HealthReport](/powershell/module/exchange/get-healthreport).

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to view a list of health sets

A *health set* is a group of monitors, probes and responders for a component that determine whether the component is healthy or unhealthy.

Run the following command to view the health sets on an Exchange server:

```powershell
Get-HealthReport -Server <ServerName>
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-HealthReport](/powershell/module/exchange/get-healthreport).

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to view the probes, monitors and responders for a health set

You can use the Exchange Management Shell to view the list of probes, monitors, and responders associated with a health set on an Exchange server.

Run the following command to view the probes, monitors and responders associated with a health set on an Exchange server:

```powershell
Get-MonitoringItemIdentity -Server <ServerName> -Identity <HealthSetName> | Format-Table Identity,ItemType,Name -Auto
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-MonitoringItemIdentity](/powershell/module/exchange/get-monitoringitemidentity).

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to View a List of Monitors and Their Current Health

The health of a monitor is reported by using the "worst of" monitors in the health set. You can view the details of a health set to see which monitors are healthy and which ones are unhealthy.

Run the following command to view a list of the monitors and their current health on an Exchange server:

```powershell
Get-ServerHealth -HealthSet <HealthSetName> -Server <ServerName> | Format-Table Name, AlertValue -Auto
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-ServerHealth](/powershell/module/exchange/get-serverhealth).
