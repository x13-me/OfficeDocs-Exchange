# Mobile device mailbox policies in Exchange Server

In Exchange Server, you can create mobile device mailbox policies to apply a common set of policies or security settings to a collection of users. After you deploy Exchange ActiveSync in your Exchange Server organization, you can create new mobile device mailbox policies or modify existing policies. When you install Exchange Server, a default mobile device mailbox policy is created. All users are automatically assigned this default mobile device mailbox policy.

## Overview of mobile device mailbox policies

You can use mobile device mailbox policies to manage many different settings. These include the following:

- Require a password

- Specify the minimum password length

- Require a number or special character in the password

- Designate how long a device can be inactive before requiring the user to re-enter a password

- Wipe a device after a specific number of failed password attempts

For more information about all the settings you can configure, see Mobile device policy settings.

## Exchange mobile device mailbox policies

Exchange ActiveSync is a client protocol that lets you synchronize a mobile device with your Exchange mailbox. Exchange ActiveSync is enabled by default when you install Exchange Server.

You can create mobile device mailbox policies in the Exchange admin center (EAC) or the Exchange Management Shell. If you create a policy in the EAC, you can configure only a subset of the available settings. You can configure the rest of the settings using the Exchange Management Shell.

## Mobile device password settings and biometrics

Many mobile devices support biometrics such as Apple Touch ID or Face ID. Exchange mobile device mailbox policies do not control whether biometrics can be used instead of typing the device PIN. Mobile device mailbox policies can be configured to require a device PIN, but then the users control whether they use biometrics after complying with the device PIN requirement.

## Mobile device password settings and Android

Android 9.0 and earlier versions utilize Android's device admin functionality to manage device password settings defined in a mobile device mailbox policy.

With Android 10.0 and later, Android has removed device admin functionality. Instead, apps that require a screen lock query the device's (or the work profile's) screen lock complexity. Apps that require a stronger screen lock direct the user to the system screen lock settings, allowing the user to update the security settings to become compliant. At no time is the app aware of the user's password; the app is only aware of the password complexity level. Android supports the following four password complexity levels:

|Password complexity level |Password requirements  |
|---------|---------|
|None     |No password requirements are configured         |
|Low     |Password can be a pattern or a PIN with either repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences         |
|Medium     |Passwords that meet one of the following criteria:<br/><br/>- PIN with no repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences with a minimum length of 4 characters <br/>- Alphabetic passwords with a minimum length of 4 characters<br/>- Alphanumeric passwords with a minimum length of 4 characters        |
|High     |Passwords that meet one of the following criteria:<br/><br/>- PIN with no repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences with a minimum length of 8 characters<br/>- Alphabetic passwords with a minimum length of 6 characters<br/>- Alphanumeric passwords with a minimum length of 6 characters         |

From the perspective of an Exchange mobile device mailbox policy, Android's password complexity levels are mapped to the following policy settings:

|Mobile device mailbox policy setting  |Android password complexity level  |
|---------|---------|
|Password enabled = false     | None        |
|Allow simple password = true<br/>Min password length < 4      |Low         |
|Allow simple password = true<br/>Min password length < 6      |Medium         |
|Allow simple password = false<br/>Alphanumeric password required = true<br/>Min password length < 6      |Medium         |
|Allow simple password = true<br/>Min password length > 6      |High         |
|Allow simple password = false<br/>Alphanumeric password required = true<br/>Min password length >= 6      |High         |

## Mobile device mailbox policy settings

The following table summarizes the settings you can specify using mobile device mailbox policies.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Allow Bluetooth|This setting specifies whether a mobile device allows Bluetooth connections. The available options are Disable, HandsFree Only, and Allow. The default value is Allow.|
|Allow Browser|This setting specifies whether Pocket Internet Explorer is allowed on the mobile device. This setting doesn't affect third-party browsers installed on the mobile device. The default value is `$true`.|
