# Perform a remote wipe on a mobile phone

Your users carry sensitive corporate information in their pockets every day. If one of them loses their mobile phone, your data can end up in the hands of another person. If one of your users loses their mobile phone, you can use the Exchange admin center (EAC) or the Exchange Management Shell to wipe their phone clean of all corporate and user information.

You can use the EAC to wipe a user's phone or cancel a remote wipe that has not yet completed.

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. Select the user, and under **Mobile Devices**, choose **View details**.

3. On the **Mobile Device Details** page, select the lost mobile device, and then select **Wipe Data**.

4. Select **Save**.

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to wipe a user's phone

You can use the **Clear-MobileDevice** cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell to wipe a user's phone.

The following command wipes the device named WM_TonySmith and sends a confirmation message to admin@contoso.com.

```
Clear-MobileDevice -Identity WM_TonySmith -NotificationEmailAddresses "admin@contoso.com"
```

Your users can use Outlook on the web to wipe their own phones.
