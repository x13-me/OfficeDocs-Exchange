# Outlook on the web in Exchange Server

The user interface in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) for Exchange Server has been optimized and simplified for use with phones and tablets. Supported web browsers give users access to more Outlook features. Unsupported web browsers give users the light version of Outlook on the web that has less features. For more information about features and supported web browsers, see [Outlook on the web (formerly Outlook Web App)](../../new-features/new-features.md#OutlookAppfrom2013) and [Outlook on the web (formerly Outlook Web App)](../../new-features/new-features.md#OutlookAppfrom2010).

When you install Exchange Server, Outlook on the web is automatically available for internal users at `https://<ServerName>/owa` (for example, `https://mailbox01.contoso.com/owa`). But, you'll likely want to configure Outlook on the web for external access (for example, `https://mail.contoso.com/owa`). For more information, see [Step 4: Configure external URLs](../../plan-and-deploy/post-installation-tasks/configure-mail-flow-and-client-access.md#step-4-configure-external-urls) in [Configure mail flow and client access on Exchange servers](../../plan-and-deploy/post-installation-tasks/configure-mail-flow-and-client-access.md).

 In an Outlook 2010 or later installation that's connected to an Exchange mailbox, you can typically see the Outlook on the web URL at **File** \> **Info** \> **Account Information** in the **Account Settings** section.

Outlook on the web is provided by the Client Access (frontend) services on Mailbox servers. In Exchange Server, Client Access services are part of the Mailbox server, so you can't configure a standalone Client Access server like you could in previous versions of Exchange. For more information, see [Client access protocol architecture](../../architecture/architecture.md#ClientAccessProtocol).
