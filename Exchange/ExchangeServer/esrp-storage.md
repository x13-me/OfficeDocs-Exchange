# Exchange Solution Reviewed Program (ESRP) Storage
The Exchange Solution Reviewed Program (ESRP) Storage is a Microsoft Exchange Server program designed to facilitate third-party storage testing and solution publishing for Exchange Server.

## About the ESRP program
The program combines a storage testing harness (Jetstress) with solution publishing guidelines. Microsoft Gold Certified or Certified Storage Partners (storage original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are part of the Microsoft Certified Partner Program) can use the ESRP framework provided to test their storage solutions targeted for Microsoft Exchange deployment. Customers can use the solutions published here to help plan/design their own Exchange storage architectures. The program is broken down in to two categories:

- ESRP Storage v 3.0: Provides Exchange 2010 specific storage solutions.
- ESRP Storage v 4.0: Provides Exchange 2013/2016 specific storage solutions. Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2016 have the same basic IO behavior so ESRP solutions for Exchange 2013 will work for Exchange 2016 and vice versa.

To participate in the program, Microsoft Partners (storage original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are part of the Microsoft Certified Partner Program) send email to esrp-storage@microsoft.com with a request to download the ESRP v3.0 zip package. Partners can then follow the testing procedure document to complete all the tests, and follow the guidelines in the whitepaper template to develop the solution whitepaper. The Microsoft Exchange product group will review the submitted solution whitepaper and performance data. Reviewed solutions will be linked to from the ESRP Web site.

> [!NOTE]
> The ESRP Storage program is not a Microsoft certification, qualification, or logo program. Microsoft makes no warranties or representations with regard to third-party storage solutions, including without limitation regarding the supportability of such third-party storage solutions. It is solely your responsibility to confirm the accuracy of the data and contents of the storage solution whitepaper you produce using the ESRP - Storage program testing framework.
