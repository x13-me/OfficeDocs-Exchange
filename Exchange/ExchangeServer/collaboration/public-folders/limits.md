# Limits for public folders

In Exchange Server, public folders are based on a mailbox architecture that allows public folders to benefit from things such as the resiliency of a Database Availability Group (DAG) and other mailbox enhancements. However, there are limits and performance considerations that should be taken into account.

## Limits

The following table lists the limits for public folders in on-premises Exchange Server. Unless the limits are specifically stated as recommended, the values listed in this table are the supported limits for public folders.

|Total public folders in hierarchy|1,000,000|Although you can create more than 1,000,000 public folders, it isn't supported. For any deployment of 100,000 or more public folders, we recommend reading [Considerations when deploying public folders](deployment-considerations.md).|
|Sub-folders under the parent folder|10,000|While you can create more than 1,000 sub-folders under a parent folder, we don't recommend that you do so._FolderHierarchyChildrenCountReceiveQuota_ parameter on the [Set-Mailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/a0d413b9-d949-4df6-ba96-ac0906dedae2.aspx) cmdlet.|
