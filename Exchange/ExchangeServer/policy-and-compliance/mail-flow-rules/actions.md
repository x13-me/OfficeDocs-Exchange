# Mail flow rule actions in Exchange Server

Actions in mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) specify what you want to do to messages that match conditions of the rule. For example, you can create a rule that forwards message from specific senders to a moderator, or adds a disclaimer or personalized signature to all outbound messages.

 Actions typically require additional properties. For example, when the rule redirects a message, you need to specify where to redirect the message. Some actions have multiple properties that are available or required. For example, when the rule adds a header field to the message header, you need to specify both the name and value of the header. When the rule adds a disclaimer to messages, you need to specify the disclaimer text, but you can also specify where to insert the text, or what to do if the disclaimer can't be added to the message. Typically, you can configure multiple actions in a rule, but some actions are exclusive. For example, one rule can't reject and redirect the same message.

For more information about mail flow rules in Exchange Server, including how multiple actions are handled, see [Mail flow rules in Exchange Server](mail-flow-rules.md).

For more information about conditions and exceptions in mail flow rules, see [Mail flow rule conditions and exceptions (predicates) in Exchange Server](conditions-and-exceptions.md).

## Actions for mail flow rules on Mailbox servers

The actions that are available in mail flow rules on Mailbox servers are described in the following table. Valid values for each property are described in [Property values](#property-values)[Property values] section.

 **Notes**:

- After you select an action in the Exchange admin center (EAC), the value that's ultimately shown in the **Do the following** field is often different from the click path you selected. Also, when you create new rules, you can sometimes (depending on the selections you make) select a short action name from a template (a filtered list of actions) instead of following the complete click path. The short names and full click path values are shown in the EAC column in the table.

- The names of some of the actions that are returned by the **Get-TransportRuleAction** cmdlet are different than the corresponding parameter names, and multiple parameters might be required for an action.

## Actions for mail flow rules on Edge Transport servers

A small subset of actions that are available on Mailbox servers are also available on Edge Transport servers, but there are also some actions that are only available on Edge Transport servers. There's no EAC on Edge Transport servers, so you can only manage mail flow rules in the Exchange Management Shell on the local Edge Transport server. The actions are described in the following table. The properties types are described in the [Property values](#property-values) section.

|**Action parameter in the Exchange Management Shell**|**Property**|**Description**|**Available on**|**Available in**|

## Property values

The property values that are used for actions in mail flow rules are described in the following table.

|**Property**|**Valid values**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|`AddedManagerAction`|One of the following values: <br/>• **To** <br/>• **Cc** <br/>• **Bcc** <br/>• **Redirect**|Specifies how to include the sender's manager in messages. <br/><br/> If you select **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc**, the sender's manager is added as a recipient in the specified field. <br/><br/> If you select **Redirect**, the message is only delivered to the sender's manager without notifying the sender or the recipient. <br/><br/> This action only works if the sender's **Manager** attribute is defined in Active Directory.|
|`Addresses`|Exchange recipients|Depending on the action, you might be able to specify any mail-enabled object in the organization, or you might be limited to a specific object type. Typically, you can select multiple recipients, but you can only send an incident report to one recipient.|
|`AuditSeverityLevel`|One of the following values: <br/>• Uncheck **Audit this rule with severity level**, or select **Audit this rule with severity level** with the value **Not specified** (`DoNotAudit`) <br/>• **Low** <br/>• **Medium** <br/>• **High**|The values **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** specify the severity level that's assigned to the incident report and to the corresponding entry in the message tracking log. <br/><br/> The other value prevents an incident report from being generated, and prevents the corresponding entry from being written to the message tracking log.|
|`DisclaimerFallbackAction`|One of the following values: <br/>• **Wrap** <br/>• **Ignore** <br/>• **Reject**|Specifies what to do if the disclaimer can't be applied to a message. There are situations where the contents of a message can't be altered (for example, the message is encrypted). The available fallback actions are: <br/><br/> **Wrap**: The original message is wrapped in a new message envelope, and the disclaimer text is inserted into the new message. This is the default value. <br/> • Subsequent mail flow rules are applied to the new message envelope, not to the original message. Therefore, configure these rules with a lower priority than other rules. <br/> • If the original message can't be wrapped in a new message envelope, the original message isn't delivered. The message is returned to the sender in an NDR. <br/><br/> **Ignore**: The rule is ignored and the message is delivered without the disclaimer <br/><br/> **Reject**: The message is returned to the sender in an NDR.|
|`DisclaimerText`|HTML string|Specifies the disclaimer text, which can include HTML tags, inline cascading style sheet (CSS) tags, and images by using the IMG tag. The maximum length is 5000 characters, including tags.|
|`DisclaimerTextLocation`|Single value: `Append` or `Prepend`|In the Exchange Management Shell, you use the _ApplyHtmlDisclaimerTextLocation_ to specify the location of the disclaimer text in the message. <br/><br/> `Append`: Add the disclaimer to the end of the message body. This is the default value. <br/><br/> `Prepend`: Add the disclaimer to the beginning of the message body.|
|`DSNEnhancedStatusCode`|Single DSN code value: <br/>• `5.7.1` <br/>• `5.7.900` through `5.7.999`|Specifies the DSN code that's used. You can create custom DSNs by using the **New-SystemMessage** cmdlet. <br/><br/> If you don't specify the rejection reason text along with the DSN code, the default reason text that's used is `Delivery not authorized, message refused`. <br/><br/> When you create or modify the rule in the Exchange Management Shell, you can specify the rejection reason text by using the _RejectMessageReasonText_ parameter.|
|`IncidentReportContent`|One or more of the following values: <br/>• **Sender** <br/>• **Recipients** <br/>• **Subject** <br/>• **Cc'd recipients** (`Cc`) <br/>• **Bcc'd recipients** (`Bcc`) <br/>• **Severity** <br/>• **Sender override information** (`Override`) <br/>• **Matching rules** (`RuleDetections`) <br/>• **False positive reports** (`FalsePositive`) <br/>• **Detected data classifications** (`DataClassifications`) <br/>• **Matching content** (`IdMatch`) <br/>• **Original mail** (`AttachOriginalMail`)|Specifies the original message properties to include in the incident report. You can choose to include any combination of these properties. In addition to the properties you specify, the message ID is always included. The available properties are: <br/><br/> **Sender**: The sender of the original message. <br/><br/> **Recipients**, **Cc'd recipients**, and **Bcc'd recipients**: All recipients of the message, or only the recipients in the **Cc** or **Bcc** fields. For each property, only the first 10 recipients are included in the incident report. <br/><br/> **Subject**: The **Subject** field of the original message. <br/><br/> **Severity**: The audit severity of the rule that was triggered. Message tracking logs include all the audit severity levels, and can be filtered by audit severity. In the EAC, if you clear the **Audit this rule with severity level** check box (in the Exchange Management Shell, the _SetAuditSeverity_ parameter value `DoNotAudit`), rule matches won't appear in the rule reports. If a message is processed by more than one rule, the highest severity is included in any incident reports. <br/><br/> **Sender override information**: The override if the sender chose to override a Policy Tip. If the sender provided a justification, the first 100 characters of the justification are also included. <br/><br/> **Matching rules**: The list of rules that the message triggered. <br/><br/> **False positive reports**: The false positive if the sender marked the message as a false positive for a Policy Tip. <br/><br/> **Detected data classifications**: The list of sensitive information types detected in the message. <br/><br/> **Matching content**: The sensitive information type detected, the exact matched content from the message, and the 150 characters before and after the matched sensitive information. <br/><br/> **Original mail**: The entire message that triggered the rule is attached to the incident report. <br/><br/> In the Exchange Management Shell, you specify multiple values separated by commas.|
|`MessageClassification`|Single message classification object|In the EAC, you select from the list of available message classifications. <br/><br/> In the Exchange Management Shell, use the **Get-MessageClassification** cmdlet to see the message classification objects that are available.|
|`MessageHeaderField`|Single string|Specifies the SMTP message header field to add, remove, or modify. <br/><br/> The *message header* is a collection of required and optional header fields in the message. Examples of header fields are **To**, **From**, **Received**, and **Content-Type**. Official header fields are defined in RFC 5322. Unofficial header fields start with **X-** and are known as *X-headers*.|
|`NotificationMessageText`|Any combination of plain text, HTML tags, and keywords|Specified the text to use in a recipient notification message. <br/><br/> In addition to plain text and HTML tags, you can specify the following keywords that use values from the original message: <br/>• `%%From%%` <br/>• `%%To%%` <br/>• `%%Cc%%` <br/>• `%%Subject%%` <br/>• `%%Headers%%` <br/>• `%%MessageDate%%`|
|`NotifySenderType`|One of the following values: <br/>• **Notify the sender, but allow them to send** (`NotifyOnly`) <br/>• **Block the message** (`RejectMessage`) <br/>• **Block the message unless it's a false positive** (`RejectUnlessFalsePositiveOverride`) <br/>• **Block the message, but allow the sender to override and send** (`RejectUnlessSilentOverride`) <br/>• **Block the message, but allow the sender to override with a business justification and send** (`RejectUnlessExplicitOverride`)|Specifies the type of Policy Tip that the sender receives if the message violates a DLP policy. The settings are described in the following list: <br/><br/> **Notify the sender, but allow them to send** The sender is notified, but the message is delivered normally. <br/><br/> **Block the message** The message is rejected, and the sender is notified. <br/><br/> **Block the message unless it's a false positive** The message is rejected unless it's marked as a false positive by the sender. <br/><br/> **Block the message, but allow the sender to override and send** The message is rejected unless the sender has chosen to override the policy restriction. <br/><br/> **Block the message, but allow the sender to override with a business justification and send** This is similar to **Block the message, but allow the sender to override and send** type, but the sender also provides a justification for overriding the policy restriction. <br/><br/> When you use this action, you need to use the **The message contains sensitive information** (_MessageContainsDataClassification_) condition.|
|`RMSTemplate`|Single RMS template object|Specifies the Rights Management Services (RMS) template that's applied to the message. <br/><br/> In the EAC, you select the RMS template from a list. <br/><br/> In the Exchange Management Shell, use the **Get-RMSTemplate** cmdlet to see the RMS templates that are available. <br/><br/> RMS requires Exchange Enterprise client access licenses (CALs) for each mailbox. For more information about CALs, see [Exchange licensing FAQs](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/exchange/microsoft-exchange-server-licensing-licensing-overview).|
|`SCLValue`|One of the following values: <br/>• **Bypass spam filtering** (`-1`) <br/>• Integers 0 through 9|Specifies the spam confidence level (SCL) that's assigned to the message. A higher SCL value indicates that a message is more likely to be spam.|
|`String`|Single string|Specifies the text that's applied to the specified message header field, NDR, or event log entry. <br/><br/> In the Exchange Management Shell, if the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").|
