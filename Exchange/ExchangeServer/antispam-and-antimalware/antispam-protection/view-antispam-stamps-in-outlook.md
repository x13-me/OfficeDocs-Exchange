# View antispam stamps in Outlook

The built-in antispam agents in Exchange Server apply diagnostic metadata, or stamps, as X-headers to messages as they enter your organization. For more information about these stamps, see [Antispam stamps](antispam-stamps.md). You can use Microsoft Outlook to view the antispam X-header fields in messages to help you diagnose spam-related problems.

## Use Outlook 2010 or later to view antispam stamps

1. Open Outlook on a client computer, and in the **Mail** view, double-click a message to open it.

2. In the **Tags** section of the Ribbon, click the **Message Options** icon to display the message **Properties** dialog box.

3. In the **Properties** dialog box, in the **Internet headers** section, use the scroll bar to view the antispam X-headers. The header fields to look for are:

   - **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SenderIdResult:**

   - **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SCL:**

   - **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-PCL:**

   - **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-Antispam-Report:**

It can be easier for you to find these values by selecting all of the text in the **Internet headers** field (CTRL key + A), copying the text (CTRL key + C, or right-click and choose **Copy**), and pasting the text into Notepad.

Here's an example of the values that you might find in a suspicious messages:

```
X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SenderIdResult:Fail
X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SCL:6
X-MS-Exchange-Organization-PCL:7X-MS-Exchange-Organization-Antispam-Report: DV:3.3.15608.880;SID:SenderIDStatus Fail;PCL:PhishingLevel SUSPICIOUS;CW:CustomList;PP:Presolved;TIME:TimeBasedFeatures;OrigIP:10.1.1.1
