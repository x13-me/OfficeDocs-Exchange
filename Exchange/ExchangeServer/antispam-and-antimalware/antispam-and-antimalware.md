# Antispam and antimalware protection in Exchange Server

Antispam and antimalware protection are included in Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019.

- Antispam protection is provided by the same built-in transport agents that were introduced in Exchange Server 2010. These agents are enabled by default on Edge Transport servers, and you can enable many of them on Exchange Mailbox servers.

- Antimalware protection is provided by the Malware agent that was introduced in Exchange Server 2013. The Malware agent is available and enabled by default on Exchange Mailbox servers.

The following table contains links to topics that provide overview information and configuration steps for customizing the built-in spam and malware filtering settings for your organization.
