Exchange 2016 CU8 or later contains seven special system mailboxes known as *arbitration mailboxes*. Arbitration mailboxes are used for storing different types of system data and for managing messaging approval workflow. The following table lists each type of arbitration mailbox and their responsibilities.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes per procedure.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform these procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Recipient Provisioning Permissions" section in the [Recipients Permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/recipient-permissions.md) topic.

- To run `Setup.exe /PrepareAD`, your account needs to be a member of the Enterprise Admins security group.

- The computer that you use to run `Setup.exe /PrepareAD` requires access to Setup.exe in the Exchange installation files:
  1. Use your most recently downloaded copy of the Exchange ISO image file, or download an updated copy from [Updates for Exchange Server](../../new-features/updates.md).
  2. In File Explorer, right-click on the Exchange ISO image file and then select **Mount**. Note the virtual DVD drive letter that's assigned.
  3. Open a Windows Command Prompt window. For example:
     - Press the Windows key + 'R' to open the **Run** dialog, type cmd.exe, and then press **OK**.
     - Press **Start**. In the **Search** box, type **Command Prompt**, then in the list of results, select **Command Prompt**.

- For more information about opening the Exchange Management Shell, see [Open the Exchange Management Shell](/powershell/exchange/open-the-exchange-management-shell).

- For more information about running Exchange Setup in unattended mode, see [Use unattended mode in Exchange Setup](../../plan-and-deploy/deploy-new-installations/unattended-installs.md).

> [!NOTE]
> - The previous _/IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_ switch will not work starting with the September 2021 Cumulative Updates (CUs). You now must use either _/IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON_ or _/IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataOFF_ for unattended and scripted installs.
>
> - The examples below use the _/IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON_ switch. It's up to you to change the switch to _/IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataOFF_.

```powershell
Set-ADServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true; Get-Mailbox -Arbitration | Format-Table Name,DisplayName
```

View the results of the command to verify that appropriate system mailbox, either by Name or Display Name from the above table, has been re-created.
