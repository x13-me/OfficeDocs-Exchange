# Recreate missing arbitration mailboxes

Exchange Server contains five special system mailboxes known as *arbitration mailboxes*. Arbitration mailboxes are used for storing different types of system data and for managing messaging approval workflow. The following table lists each type of arbitration mailbox and their responsibilities.

|**Arbitration mailbox Name**|**Display name**|**Persisted capabilities**|**Function**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|FederatedEmail.4c1f4d8b-8179-4148-93bf-00a95fa1e042|Microsoft Exchange Federation Mailbox|none|This mailbox stores data used to maintain federation between different Exchange organizations. This includes Rights Management Services, cross-premises mail-flow monitoring probes and responses, notifications, online archives, messaging records management, and cross-premises free/busy information.|
|Migration.8f3e7716-2011-43e4-96b1-aba62d229136|Microsoft Exchange Migration|Management|Stores data for the Exchange migration service to use when moving mailboxes in batches.|
|SystemMailbox{1f05a927-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX} <br/> (for example, SystemMailbox{1f05a927-9350-4efe-a823-5529c2d64109}; most of the mailbox name is unique to your organization)|Microsoft Exchange Approval Assistant|none|This mailbox is provisioned for use by the Exchange approval framework for recipient moderation and auto group approval requests.|

If you need to re-create one of more of these arbitration mailboxes, see the instructions that follow.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes per procedure.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform these procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Recipient Provisioning Permissions" section in the [Recipients Permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/recipient-permissions.md) topic.

- To run `Setup.exe /PrepareAD`, your account needs to be a member of the Enterprise Admins security group.

- The computer that you use to run `Setup.exe /PrepareAD` requires access to Setup.exe in the Exchange installation files:

  1. Use your most recently downloaded copy of the Exchange ISO image file, or download an updated copy from [Updates for Exchange Server](../../new-features/updates.md).

  2. In File Explorer, right-click on the Exchange ISO image file and then select **Mount**. Note the virtual DVD drive letter that's assigned.

  3. Open a Windows Command Prompt window. For example:

     - Press the Windows key + 'R' to open the **Run** dialog, type cmd.exe, and then press **OK**.

     - Press **Start**. In the **Search** box, type **Command Prompt**, then in the list of results, select **Command Prompt**.

- For more information about opening the Exchange Management Shell, see [Open the Exchange Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/open-the-exchange-management-shell).

- For more information about running Exchange Setup in unattended mode, see [Use unattended mode in Exchange Setup](../../plan-and-deploy/deploy-new-installations/unattended-installs.md).
