# Certificate procedures in Exchange Server

Ensuring that certificates are installed and configured correctly is key to delivering a secure messaging infrastructure for the enterprise. In Exchange Server you can manage certificates in the Exchange admin center (EAC), and in the Exchange Management Shell. Certificate management in the EAC has been improved over certificate management in the Exchange Management Console in Exchange Server 2010. Specifically, certificate management in the EAC can help administrators by:

- Minimizing the number of certificates that are required.

- Minimizing the interaction that's required for certificates.

- Allowing the centralized installation and management of certificates on all Exchange servers in the organization.

For more information about certificates in Exchange, see [Digital certificates and encryption in Exchange Server](certificates.md).

The tasks that are associated with certificate management in Exchange are described in the following table.

|**Task**|**EAC**|**Exchange Management Shell**|**Topic**|**Comments**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Create a new self-signed certificate on an Exchange server.|**Servers** \> **Certificates** \> select the server \> **Add** ![Add icon.](../../media/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.png) \> **Create a self-signed certificate**|**New-ExchangeCertificate**|[Create a new Exchange Server self-signed certificate](create-self-signed-certificates.md)|You can create new self-signed certificates and configure the certificates for Exchange services in one step.|
|Create a new certificate request (also known as a certificate signing request or CSR) for a certification authority (CA).|**Servers** \> **Certificates** \> select the server \> **Add** ![Add icon.](../../media/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.png) \> **Create a request for a certificate from a certification authority**|**New-ExchangeCertificate** with the _GenerateRequest_ switch.|[Create an Exchange Server certificate request for a certification authority](create-ca-certificate-requests.md)|The procedures are the same for an internal CA (for example, Active Directory Certificate Services) or a commercial CA.|
|Complete a pending certificate request on an Exchange server.|**Servers** \> **Certificates** \> select the server \> select the certificate request \> click the **Complete** link in the details pane.|**Import-ExchangeCertificate**|[Complete a pending Exchange Server certificate request](complete-pending-certificate-requests.md)|After you receive the certificate file or files from the CA, you install them on the Exchange server.|

|Delete an existing certificate or certificate request from an Exchange server.|**Servers** \> **Certificates** \> select the server \> select the certificate \> **Delete** ![Delete icon.](../../media/ITPro_EAC_DeleteIcon.png)|**Remove-ExchangeCertificate**|n/a|The procedures are the same for self-signed certificates, certificate requests, or certificates issued by a CA.|

You can't import an exported pending certificate request.|
