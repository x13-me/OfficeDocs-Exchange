# KB2619234 update not installed [Win7RpcHttpAssocCookieGuidUpdateNotInstalled]

Exchange Server 2016 Setup can't continue because the local computer requires a software update. You'll need to install this update before Exchange 2016 Setup can continue.

Exchange 2016 Setup requires a Windows Server update that allows Outlook Anywhere (RPC over HTTP) to work correctly.

Download and install the 64-bit update from [KB2619234](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=3052&kbid=2619234), and then click **retry** on the **Readiness Checks** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If this update requires a reboot to complete installation, you'll need to exit Exchange 2016 Setup, reboot, and then start Setup again.

Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at: [Exchange Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=60612).
