# Exchange Server readiness checks

The topics in this are provide details about the readiness checks that Exchange Server performs when Exchange is installed. Readiness checks ensure that your Active Directory forest and Exchange servers are ready for the version of Exchange that you're installing. Each readiness check topic describes the actions that you can take to resolve issues that are found when the readiness checks are run. You should only perform the steps outlined in a readiness check topic if that readiness check was displayed during setup.
