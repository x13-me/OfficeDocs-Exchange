# Exchange Server readiness checks

The article provides details about the readiness checks that Exchange Server does when Exchange is installed. Readiness checks ensure that your Active Directory forest and Exchange servers are ready for the version of Exchange that you're installing. Each readiness check article describes the actions that you can take to resolve issues that are found when the readiness checks are run. You should only do the steps outlined in a readiness check article if that readiness check was displayed during setup.
