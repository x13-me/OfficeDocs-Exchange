# Installation of the first Exchange server in the organization can't be delegated [DelegatedClientAccessFirstInstall]

Exchange Setup can't continue because this is the first Exchange server in the organization, and the first Exchange server needs to be installed by a member of the Enterprise Admins security group (to create the Exchange Organization container and configure objects in it).

**Note**: If you haven't already [extended the Active Directory schema for Exchange](../prepare-ad-and-domains.md#step-1-extend-the-active-directory-schema), you need to do one of the following steps:

- A member of the Schema Admins group can extend the Active Directory schema using another computer in the domain before you install Exchange.

- Exchange Setup can extend the schema if your account is a member of the Schema Admins group.

To resolve this issue, run Exchange setup again using an account that's a member of the Enterprise Admins security group (add the current account or use a different account).

Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at: [Exchange Server](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/home?category=exchangeserver).
