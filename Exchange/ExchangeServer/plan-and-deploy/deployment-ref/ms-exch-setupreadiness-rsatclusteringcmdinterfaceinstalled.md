# Failover Cluster Command Interface Windows feature not installed [RsatClusteringCmdInterfaceInstalled]

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Setup can't continue because the local computer is missing a required Windows feature. You'll need to install this Windows feature before Exchange 2016 can continue.

Exchange 2016 Setup requires that the **Failover Cluster Command Interface** Windows feature be installed on the computer before installation can continue.

Do the following to install the Windows feature on this computer. If the feature requires a reboot to complete installation, you'll need to exit Exchange 2016 Setup, reboot, and then start Setup again.

> [!NOTE]
> Additional Windows features or updates might need to be installed before Exchange 2016 Setup can continue. For a complete list of required Windows features and updates, check out [Exchange Server prerequisites](../../plan-and-deploy/prerequisites.md).

1. Open Windows PowerShell on the local computer.

2. Run the following command to install the required Windows feature.

   ```powershell
   Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-Clustering-CmdInterface
   ```
