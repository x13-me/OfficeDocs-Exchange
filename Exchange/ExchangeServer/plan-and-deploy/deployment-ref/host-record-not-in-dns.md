# The Host record for the local computer cannot be found in the DNS database [HostRecordMissing]

Exchange Setup can't continue because the Host (A) record for this computer can't be found in the DNS zone for the domain. Setup requires a valid A record for the server, and Exchange uses email server A records to find the IP address of the next hop to send messages.

To resolve this issue:

- Verify that the local TCP/IP configuration points to the correct DNS server. For more information, see [Configure TCP/IP settings](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731673(v=ws.10)).

- Use Nslookup.exe to verify that the Host (A) record exists on the DNS server. For more information, see [To verify A resource records exist in DNS](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/cc772976(v=ws.10)).

For information about DNS name resolution, troubleshooting, and A records, see the following:

- [Troubleshooting DNS](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc753041(v=ws.11))

- [Managing resource records](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754308(v=ws.11))
