# Exchange Server prerequisites

> [!TIP]
> Looking for Exchange 2013 prerequisites? See [Exchange 2013 prerequisites](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb691354(v=exchg.150).aspx).

This topic provides the steps for installing the necessary Windows Server operating system prerequisites for Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 Mailbox servers and Edge Transport servers, and also the Windows prerequisites for installing the Exchange Management Tools on Windows client computers.

After you've prepared your environment for Exchange Server, use the Exchange Deployment Assistant for the next steps in your actual deployment. For information on hybrid deployments, see [Exchange Server Hybrid Deployments](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj200581(v=exchg.150).aspx).

> [!TIP]
> Have you heard about the Exchange Server Deployment Assistant? It's a free online tool that helps you quickly deploy Exchange Server in your organization by asking you a few questions and creating a customized deployment checklist just for you. If you want to learn more about it, go to [Microsoft Exchange Server Deployment Assistant](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=626978).

To actually install Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019, see [Deploy new installations of Exchange](deploy-new-installations/deploy-new-installations.md).

## Exchange 2019 prerequisites for preparing Active Directory

You can use any member of the Active Directory domain to prepare Active Directory for Exchange 2019.

1. The computer requires the following software:

    a. [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=863265) or later

    b. [Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2012](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679)
