# Exchange Server prerequisites

This topic provides the steps for installing the necessary Windows Server operating system prerequisites for Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 Mailbox servers and Edge Transport servers, and also the Windows prerequisites for installing the Exchange Management Tools on Windows client computers.

After you've prepared your environment for Exchange Server, use the Exchange Deployment Assistant for the next steps in your actual deployment. For information on hybrid deployments, see [Exchange Server Hybrid Deployments](../../ExchangeHybrid/exchange-hybrid.md).

To actually install Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019, see [Deploy new installations of Exchange](deploy-new-installations/deploy-new-installations.md).

## Exchange 2019 prerequisites for preparing Active Directory

You can use any member of the Active Directory domain to prepare Active Directory for Exchange 2019.

1. The computer requires the following software:

   a. [.NET Framework 4.8](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/014120d7-d689-4305-befd-3cb711108212/0fd66638cde16859462a6243a4629a50/ndp48-x86-x64-allos-enu.exe)

      > [!NOTE]
      > When installing on Windows Server Core, you must use key "/q" for install this package. Optionaly you can use "/log [PATH]" for logging.

   b. [Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2012](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679)

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > - The system requirements for the Visual C++ Redistributable package do not mention support for Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019, but the redistributable package is safe to install on these versions of Windows.
      >
      > - An overview of the latest supported versions is available at: [Visual C++ Redistributable versions](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).
      >
      > - The Visual C++ redistributable package is required if you're using the Exchange Setup Wizard to prepare Active Directory. If you're using unattended Setup from the command line to prepare Active Directory, this package isn't required. For more information, see [Prepare Active Directory and domains](prepare-ad-and-domains.md).

2. Install the Remote Tools Administration Pack by running the following command in Windows PowerShell:

   ```PowerShell
   Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-ADDS
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Using the Exchange Setup Wizard to prepare Active Directory requires the installation of the Management Tools Exchange role.
