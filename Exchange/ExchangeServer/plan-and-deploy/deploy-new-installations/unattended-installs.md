# Use unattended mode in Exchange Setup

Running Exchange Setup from the command line allows you to automate the installation of Exchange do and other related tasks on Exchange servers (for example, remove an existing Exchange server or recover a failed Exchange server).

This topic describes the available command line switches, and provides examples.

For more information about planning for Exchange 2016 or Exchange 2019, see [Planning and deployment for Exchange Server](../../plan-and-deploy/plan-and-deploy.md).

For information about tasks to complete after installation, see [Exchange Server post-installation tasks](../post-installation-tasks/post-installation-tasks.md).

## Primary command line switches for unattended mode

The primary (top-level, scenario-defining) command line switches that are available in unattended Setup mode in Exchange 2016 or Exchange 2019 are described in the following table:

|**Switch**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|_/IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_|This switch is required in all unattended setup commands (whenever you run Setup.exe with any additional switches). If you don't use this switch, you'll get an error. To read the license terms, visit [Microsoft License Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/useterms). </br></br> **Note:** Beginning with the September 2021 Cumulative Updates, this switch is no longer available in Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2019.|
|/IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON</br>/IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataOFF|This switch is required in all unattended setup commands (whenever you run Setup.exe with any additional switches). If you don't use this switch, you'll get an error. To read the license terms, visit [Microsoft License Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/useterms).</br>To accept the license terms and send diagnostic data to Microsoft use the switch with suffix *DiagnosticDataON*.</br>To accept the license terms but not send diagnostic data to Microsoft use the switch with suffix *DiagnosticDataOFF*.</br></br>**Note:** These switches are available beginning with the September 2021 Cumulative Updates for Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019.|
|_/Mode:\<InstallationMode\>_ <br/> (or _/m:\<InstallationMode\>_)|Valid values are: <br/>• **Install**: Installs Exchange on a new server using the Exchange server roles specified by the _/Roles_ switch. This is the default value if the command doesn't use the _/Mode_ switch. <br/>• **Uninstall**: Uninstalls Exchange from a working server. <br/>• **Upgrade**: Installs a Cumulative Update (CU) on an Exchange server. <br/>• **RecoverServer**: Recovers an Exchange server using the existing Exchange server object in Active Directory after a catastrophic hardware or software failure on the server. For instructions, see [Recover Exchange servers](../../high-availability/disaster-recovery/recover-exchange-servers.md).|
|_/Roles:\<ServerRole\>_ <br/> (or _/Role:\<ServerRole\>_ or _/r:\<ServerRole\>_)|This switch is required in `/Mode:Install` commands. Valid values are: <br/>• **Mailbox (or mb)**: Installs the Mailbox server role and the Exchange management tools on the local server. This is the default value. You can't use this value with **EdgeTransport**. <br/>• **EdgeTransport (or et)**: Installs the Edge Transport server role and the Exchange management tools on the local server. You can't use this value with **Mailbox**. <br/>• **ManagementTools (or mt or t)**: Installs the Exchange management tools on clients or other Windows servers that aren't running Exchange.|
|_/PrepareAD_ (or _/p_) <br/> _/PrepareSchema_ (or _/ps_) <br/> _/PrepareDomain:\<DomainFQDN\>_ (or _/pd:\<DomainFQDN\>_) <br/> _/PrepareAllDomains_ (or _/pad_)|Use these switches to extend the Active Directory schema for Exchange, prepare Active Directory for Exchange, and prepare some or all Active Directory domains for Exchange. For more information, see [Prepare Active Directory and domains for Exchange](../prepare-ad-and-domains.md)|
|_/NewProvisionedServer[:\<ServerName\>]_ (or _/nprs[:\<ServerName\>]_ <br/> _/RemoveProvisionedServer:\<ServerName\>_ (or _/rprs:\<ServerName\>_)|The _/NewProvisionedServer_ switch creates the Exchange server object in Active Directory. After that, a member of the Delegated Setup role group can install Exchange on the server. For more information, see [Delegate the installation of Exchange servers](delegate-installations.md). <br/><br/> The _/RemoveProvisionedServer_ switch removes a provisioned Exchange server object from Active Directory _before_ Exchange is installed on the server.|
|_/AddUmLanguagePack:\<Culture1\>,\<Culture2\>...\<CultureN\>_ <br/> _/RemoveUmLanguagePack:\<Culture1\>,\<Culture2\>...\<CultureN\>_|**Note**: These switches aren't available in Exchange 2019. They're only available in Exchange 2016. <br/><br/> Adds or removes Unified Messaging (UM) language packs from existing Exchange 2016 Mailbox servers. UM language packs enable callers and Outlook Voice Access users to interact with the UM system in those languages. You can't add or remove the en-US language pack. <br/> You can install language packs on existing Mailbox servers by using the _/AddUmLanguagePack_ switch or by running the UMLanguagePack.\<Culture\>.exe file directly. You can only remove installed language packs by using the _/RemoveUmLanguagePack_ switch. For more information, see [UM languages, prompts, and greetings](../../../ExchangeServer2013/um-languages-prompts-and-greetings-exchange-2013-help.md).|

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Download the latest version of Exchange on the target computer. For more information, see [Updates for Exchange Server](../../new-features/updates.md).

- Verify the network, computer hardware, operating system, and software requirements at: [Exchange Server system requirements](../../plan-and-deploy/system-requirements.md) and [Exchange Server prerequisites](../../plan-and-deploy/prerequisites.md).

- Verify that you've read the release notes at [Release notes for Exchange Server](../../release-notes.md).

  > [!CAUTION]
  > After you install Exchange on a server, you must not change the server name. Renaming a server after you've installed an Exchange server role is not supported.

- For Mailbox servers:

  - Estimated time to complete: 60 minutes

  - The target server must be a member of an Active Directory domain.

  - The account that you use to install Exchange requires the following permissions:<sup>\*</sup>:

    - **Enterprise Admins group membership**: Required if this is the first Exchange server in the organization.

    - **Schema Admins group membership**: Required if you haven't previously [extended the Active Directory schema](../../plan-and-deploy/prepare-ad-and-domains.md#step-1-extend-the-active-directory-schema) or [prepared Active Directory](../../plan-and-deploy/prepare-ad-and-domains.md#step-2-prepare-active-directory) for Exchange.

    - **Exchange Organization Management role group membership**: Required if you've already [prepared the Active Directory domain](../../plan-and-deploy/prepare-ad-and-domains.md#step-3-prepare-active-directory-domains) that will contain the Exchange server, or if other Exchange servers already exist in the organization.

    <sup>\*</sup> Members of the **Delegated Setup** role group can install Exchange on servers that have already been provisioned in Active Directory by an Exchange administrator. For more information, see [Delegate the installation of Exchange servers](../../plan-and-deploy/deploy-new-installations/delegate-installations.md).

- For Edge Transport servers:

  - Estimated time to complete: 40 minutes

  - We recommend that you install Edge Transport servers in a perimeter network that's outside of your organization's internal Active Directory forest. Installing the Edge Transport server role on domain-joined computers only enables domain management of Windows features and settings. Edge Transport servers don't directly access Active Directory. Instead, they use Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to store configuration and recipient information. For more information about the Edge Transport role, see [Edge Transport servers](../../architecture/edge-transport-servers/edge-transport-servers.md).

  - Verify the local account on the target computer is a member of the local Administrators group on the target server.

  - You need to configure the primary DNS suffix on the computer. For example, if the fully qualified domain name of your computer is edge.contoso.com, the DNS suffix for the computer is contoso.com. For more information, see [Primary DNS Suffix is missing [ms.exch.setupreadiness.FqdnMissing]](../../plan-and-deploy/deployment-ref/ms-exch-setupreadiness-fqdnmissing.md).

  - In coexistence scenarios, Exchange 2010 Hub Transport servers need an update before you can subscribe a Exchange 2016 Edge Transport server to an Active Directory site that contains Exchange 2010 Hub Transport servers. If you don't install this update, the EdgeSync Subscription won't work correctly for Exchange 2010 Hub Transport server that participate in EdgeSync synchronization. For more information, see [Supported coexistence scenarios for Exchange 2016](../system-requirements.md?view=exchserver-2016&preserve-view=true#supported-coexistence-scenarios-for-exchange-2016).

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](../../about-documentation/exchange-admin-center-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## Use Setup.exe to install Exchange in unattended mode

1. On the target server, open File Explorer, right-click on the Exchange ISO image file that you downloaded, and then select **Mount**. Note the virtual DVD drive letter that's assigned.

2. Open a Windows Command Prompt window. For example:

   - Press the Windows key + 'R' to open the **Run** dialog, type cmd.exe, and then press **OK**.

   - Press **Start**. In the **Search** box, type **Command Prompt**, then in the list of results, select **Command Prompt**.

3. In the Command Prompt window, use the following syntax:

   ```console
   <Virtual DVD drive letter>:\Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON [Switches]
   ```

   Setup copies the setup files to the local computer.

   Setup checks the prerequisites, including all prerequisites specific to the server roles that you're installing. If you haven't met all the prerequisites, Setup fails and returns an error message that explains the reason for the failure. If you've met all the prerequisites, Setup installs Exchange.

4. Restart the server after the Exchange installation is complete.

5. Complete your deployment by performing the tasks provided in [Exchange Server post-installation tasks](../../plan-and-deploy/post-installation-tasks/post-installation-tasks.md).

## Unattended mode examples

### Prepare Active Directory for Exchange in unattended mode

This example configures "Fabrikam Ltd" as the Exchange organization name in Active Directory and prepares Active Directory for the version of Exchange that's being installed.

```console
Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON /PrepareAD /OrganizationName:"Fabrikam Ltd"
```

For more information, see [Prepare Active Directory and domains for Exchange](../prepare-ad-and-domains.md).

### Install Mailbox servers in unattended mode

- This example installs the first Exchange server (Mailbox server) in the organization, configures "Contoso Corporation" as the Exchange organization name in Active Directory, and installs the Exchange management tools on the local server.

   ```console
   Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON /Mode:Install /Roles:Mailbox /on:"Contoso Corporation"
   ```

- This example installs the Mailbox server role and the management tools in the default folder on the local server in an organization where Active Directory has already been prepared for the version of Exchange that's being installed.

   ```console
   Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON /mode:Install /r:MB
   ```

- This example installs the Mailbox server role and the management tools in the "C:\Exchange Server" folder on the local server.

   ```console
   Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON /Mode:Install /Role:Mailbox /TargetDir:"C:\Exchange Server"
   ```

- This example installs the Mailbox server role on the local server by using the settings in the ExchangeConfig.txt file.

   ```console
   Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON /mode:Install /role:Mailbox /AnswerFile:c:\ExchangeConfig.txt
   ```

- This example uses the domain controller named DC01 to read from and write to Active Directory while installing the Mailbox server role and the management tools on the local server.

   ```console
   Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON /mode:Install /role:Mailbox /DomainController:DC01
   ```

- This example updates Exchange Setup with patches from the specified folder, and then installs the Mailbox server role and the management tools on the local server. In Exchange 2016 only, if any UM language packs are located in this folder, the language packs are automatically installed.

   ```console
   Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON /role:Mailbox /UpdatesDir:"C:\ExchangeServer\New Patches"
   ```

### Install Edge Transport servers in unattended mode

- This example installs the Edge Transport server role and the management tools in the default location on the local server.

   ```console
   Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms /mode:Install /r:EdgeTransport
   ```

- This example installs the Edge Transport server role and the management tools in the specified folder on the local server.

   ```console
   Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms /mode:Install /r:ET /TargetDir:"D:\Exchange Server"
   ```

### Uninstall Exchange from servers in unattended mode

This example completely removes Exchange from the local server and removes the server's Exchange configuration from Active Directory.

```console
Setup.exe /mode:Uninstall
```

### Remove provisioned Exchange server objects from Active Directory in unattended mode

This example removes the provisioned Exchange server object named Exchange03 from Active Directory _before_ Exchange is installed on the server (if Exchange is already installed on the server, the command won't work).

```console
Setup.exe /rprs:Exchange03
```

For more information, see [Delegate the installation of Exchange servers](delegate-installations.md).

### Add and remove UM language packs from existing Exchange 2016 Mailbox servers in unattended mode

> [!NOTE]
> These procedures aren't available in Exchange 2019.

- This example installs the Russian and Spain Spanish language packs on the local Exchange 2016 Mailbox server from the specified folder.

   ```console
   Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataON /AddUmLanguagePack:ru-RU,es-ES /SourceDir:"D:\UM Language Packs"
   ```

- This example uninstalls the Korean UM language pack from the local Exchange 2016 Mailbox server.

   ```console
   Setup.exe  /RemoveUmLanguagePack:ko-KR
   ```
