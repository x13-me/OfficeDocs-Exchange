### Establish an Exchange 2016 or Exchange 2019 test environment

Before you install your first Exchange server, we recommend that you install Exchange in an isolated test environment. This approach reduces the risk of end-user downtime and negative ramifications to the production environment.

The test environment will act as your "proof of concept" for your new Exchange design and make it possible to move forward or roll back any implementations before deploying into your production environments. Having an exclusive test environment for validation and testing allows you to do pre-installation checks for your future production environments. By installing in a test environment first, we believe that your organization will have a better likelihood of success in a full production implementation.

For many organizations, the costs of building a test lab may be high because of the need to duplicate the production environment. To reduce the hardware costs associated with a prototype lab, we recommend the use of virtualization by using Hyper-V technologies in Windows Server. Hyper-V enables server virtualization, allowing multiple virtual operating systems to run on a single physical machine.

For more detailed information about Hyper-V, see [Server Virtualization](/windows-server/virtualization/virtualization). For information about the Microsoft support of production Exchange servers on hardware virtualization software, see [Exchange Server virtualization](virtualization.md).

## Deploy Exchange 2016 or Exchange 2019

During the deployment phase, you install Exchange into your organization. Before you begin the deployment phase, you should plan your Exchange organization. For more information, see the [Plan for Exchange Server](#plan-for-exchange-server) section earlier in this topic.

Use the information at the following links to help you deploy Exchange.

[Prepare Active Directory and domains for Exchange](prepare-ad-and-domains.md)

> Learn about the steps you need to take to prepare your Active Directory forest for Exchange 2019 and the changes Exchange makes to your forest.

[Install Exchange Mailbox servers using the Setup wizard](deploy-new-installations/install-mailbox-role.md)

> Learn about using the Setup wizard to install Mailbox servers.

  Always install the **latest Exchange Cumulative Update** (CU) ([Exchange Server build numbers and release dates | Microsoft Docs](../new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates.md)). There is no need to install the RTM build or previous builds and then upgrade to the latest Cumulative Update. This is because each Cumulative Update is a full build of the product.

  Update with **latest Exchange Security Update** (SU) **before** bringing the server online. Verify with the Exchange Health Checker script: <https://aka.ms/ExchangeHealthChecker>.

[Use unattended mode in Exchange Setup](deploy-new-installations/unattended-installs.md)

> Learn about using the unattended setup at the command line to install, remove, update, and recover Exchange servers.

[Install Exchange Edge Transport servers using the Setup wizard](deploy-new-installations/install-edge-transport-role.md)

> Learn about using the Setup wizard to install Edge Transport servers in a perimeter network.

[Upgrade Exchange to the latest Cumulative Update](install-cumulative-updates.md)

> Learn about finding and installing the latest Cumulative Update (CU) for the Exchange servers in your organization.

  Keep your servers as **up to date** as possible. Always be either on latest released Exchange Cumulative Update (CU) or latest released -1 CU.

   1. This page contains links to the latest Exchange CU bits: [Exchange Server build numbers and release dates | Microsoft Docs](../new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates.md).

   2. See: [Upgrade Exchange to the latest Cumulative Update | Microsoft Docs](./install-cumulative-updates.md).

  Ensure **Windows Update/Microsoft Update** (WU/MU) is turned on and consider further turning on **Automatic Update** to pick up Security Updates (SU's).

  Use an **elevated command prompt** to run [any Cumulative Update or Security Update](/exchange/troubleshoot/setup/ex2019-setup-does-not-run-correctly-started-powershell). If you run into any problems when running update setup, please see <https://aka.ms/exupdatefaq>.

  Periodically, run the **Exchange Health Checker** script will check if the latest Exchange SUs are in place: <https://aka.ms/ExchangeHealthChecker>.

[Exchange Server Hybrid Deployments](../../ExchangeHybrid/exchange-hybrid.md)

> Read this topic for information that will help you deploy Exchange in an existing hybrid deployment.

> Learn about post-installation tasks to complete your Exchange installation.

## Exchange Setup

You can use different types and modes of Exchange Setup to install and maintain the various editions and versions of Exchange.

### Exchange editions and versions

Exchange is available in two server editions: Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition. The edition you install is defined by your product key (the only available download can install both versions). For more information, see [Exchange licensing FAQs](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/exchange/microsoft-exchange-server-licensing-licensing-overview).

### Types of Exchange Setup

You have the following options for Exchange Setup:

- **Exchange Setup wizard**: Running Setup.exe without any command line switches provides an interactive experience where you're guided by the Exchange 2019 Setup wizard.

- **Exchange unattended setup**: Running Setup.exe with command line switches enables you to install Exchange from an interactive command line or through a script.

### Modes of Exchange Setup

Exchange setup includes the following modes:

- **Install**: Install a new server role (Mailbox server, Edge Transport server, or Management tools). This mode is available in the Exchange Setup wizard and unattended setup.

- **Uninstall**: Remove the Exchange installation from a computer. You can use this mode from both the Exchange Setup wizard and unattended setup.

- **Upgrade**: Install a CU on an existing Exchange server. You can use this mode from both the Exchange Setup wizard and unattended setup.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Exchange doesn't support in-place upgrades from previous versions. This mode is used only to install CUs.

- **RecoverServer**: You need to recover data from the Exchange server after a catastrophic failure. To do this, you install a new Windows server with the same FQDN as the failed server (for example, mailbox01.contoso.com), and then run Exchange Setup with the _/Mode:RecoverServer_ switch without specifying the Exchange server roles to restore.

    Setup detects the Exchange server object in Active Directory and installs the corresponding files and configuration automatically. After you recover the server, you can restore databases and reconfigure any additional settings. To run in **RecoverServer** mode:

    - Exchange can't be already installed on the server.

    - The Exchange server object must exist in Active Directory.

    - You can only use unattended setup.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You must complete one mode of Setup before you can use another mode.
