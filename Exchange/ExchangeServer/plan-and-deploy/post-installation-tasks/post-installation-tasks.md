**Note**:

If you've enabled the Scripting Agent in your Exchange organization, and you keep a customized %ExchangeInstallPath%Bin\CmdletExtensionAgents\ScriptingAgentConfig.xml file on all of your Mailbox servers, you need to copy that file to every new Mailbox server that you deploy in your organization (the file isn't used on Edge Transport servers).

- The default value of %ExchangeInstallationPath% is %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\, but the actual value is wherever you installed Exchange on the server.

- The default name of the file on a new Exchange server is %ExchangeInstallPath%Bin\CmdletExtensionAgents\ScriptingAgentConfig.xml.sample. As part of enabling the Scripting Agent in your organization, you need to rename this file to ScriptingAgentConfig.xml and customize it or replace it with your existing ScriptingAgentConfig.xml file.

For more information about the Scripting Agent in Exchange 2013 (which still applies to Exchange 2016 and 2019), see [Scripting Agent](../../../ExchangeServer2013/cmdlet-extension-agents-exchange-2013-help.md#scripting-agent).
