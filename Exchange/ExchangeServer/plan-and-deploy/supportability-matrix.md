# Exchange Server supportability matrix

The Exchange Server supportability matrix provides a central source for Exchange administrators to easily locate information about the level of support available for any configuration or required component for supported versions of Microsoft Exchange Server.

## Release model

The following table identifies the release model for each supported version of Exchange.

In Exchange Server 2010 and earlier, each update rollup package (RU) is cumulative. An RU for Exchange Server 2010 includes all fixes for Exchange Server from all previous update rollup packages, so you only need to install the latest RU to apply all of the fixes that were released up to that point. However, individual updates or hotfixes for Exchange 2010 or earlier do not contain all previous fixes for Exchange Server. The updated files that are included in an individual update or hotfix include all updates that were applied only to those specific files by all previous updates, but any other files on Exchange Server will not be updated. For more information, see [Exchange 2010 Servicing](/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/).

In Exchange Server 2013 or later, we changed the way we deliver hotfixes and service packs by using a scheduled delivery model. In this model, cumulative updates (CUs) are released quarterly (every three months). Each CU is a full installation of Exchange that includes updates and changes from all previous CUs, so you don't need to install any previous CUs or Exchange Server RTM first. For more information, see [Updates for Exchange Server](../new-features/updates.md).

|Servicing release model|Exchange 2019|Exchange 2016|Exchange 2013|Exchange 2010|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Cumulative updates (CUs)|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|
|Update rollups (RUs)|No|No|No|Yes|
|Security hotfixes delivered separately|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, no additional CUs are planned for Exchange Server 2013 and no additional RUs are planned for Exchange Server 2010.

## Support lifecycle

For more information about the support lifecycle for specific versions of Exchange, Windows Server, or Windows client operating systems, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4095338/microsoft-lifecycle-policy) page. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17140/lifecycle-faq-general-policy).

## Exchange Server 2007 End-of life

Exchange 2007 reached end of support on April 11, 2017, per the [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4095338/microsoft-lifecycle-policy). There will be no new security updates, non-security updates, free or paid assisted support options, or online technical content updates. Furthermore, as adoption of Microsoft 365 or Office 365 accelerates and cloud usage increases, custom support options for Office products will not be available. This includes Exchange Server, as well as Microsoft Office, SharePoint Server, Office Communications Server, Lync Server, Skype for Business Server, Project Server, and Visio. At this time, we encourage customers to complete their migration and upgrade plans. We recommend that customers leverage deployment benefits provided by Microsoft and Microsoft Certified Partners including [Microsoft FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/) for cloud migrations, and [Software Assurance Planning Services](https://partner.microsoft.com/marketing/planning-services) for on-premises upgrades.

## Supported operating system platforms

The following tables identify the operating system platforms on which each version of Exchange can run.

However, if rendering or authentication issues occur in a mobile browser, determine whether the issue can be reproduced by using Outlook Web App Light in the full client of a supported browser. For example, test the use of Outlook Web App Light in Safari, Chrome, or Internet Explorer. If the issue can't be reproduced in the full client, we recommend that you contact the mobile device vendor for help. In these cases, we collaborate with the vendor as appropriate.

## Microsoft .NET Framework

The following tables identify the versions of the Microsoft .NET Framework that can be used with the specified versions of Exchange.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Versions of the .NET Framework that aren't listed in the tables below are not supported on any version of Exchange. This includes minor and patch-level releases of the .NET Framework.
>
> If you're upgrading Exchange Server from an unsupported CU to the current CU and no intermediate CUs are available, you should first upgrade to the latest version of .NET that's supported by your version of Exchange Server and then immediately upgrade to the current CU. This method doesn't replace the need to keep your Exchange servers up to date and on the latest supported CU. Microsoft makes no claim that an upgrade failure will not occur using this method, which may result in the need to contact Microsoft Support Services.

To upgrade the .NET Framework on an existing Exchange Server, do the following steps:

1. Put DAG member servers into [maintenance mode](../high-availability/manage-ha/manage-dags.md#performing-maintenance-on-dag-members) by replacing \<ServerName\> with the name of the server and running the following command in the Exchange Management Shell:

   ```powershell
   Set-ServerComponentState <ServerName> -Component ServerWideOffline -State Inactive -Requester Maintenance
   ```

2. Stop all Exchange services. For example:
   - Use services.msc
   - Run the following Windows PowerShell command twice:

     ```powershell
     Get-Service *exch* | Stop-Service
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > We do not recommend using the *Force* switch in the command to stop all Exchange services.

3. Download and install the latest supported version of the .NET Framework as described in the tables in the next section.

4. Reboot the server after the .NET Framework installation is complete.

5. Install the latest available CU as described in [Updates for Exchange Server](../new-features/updates.md).

   For Exchange 2013, see [Updates for Exchange 2013](../../ExchangeServer2013/updates-for-exchange-2013-exchange-2013-help.md)

6. Reboot the server after the CU installation is complete.

7. Verify that all Exchange services are in their normal start mode and started. For example:
   - Use services.msc
   - Run the following Windows PowerShell command:

     ```powershell
     Get-Service *exch*
     ```

8. Take DAG member servers out of [maintenance mode](../high-availability/manage-ha/manage-dags.md#performing-maintenance-on-dag-members) by replacing \<ServerName\> with the name of the server and running the following command in the Exchange Management Shell:

   ```powershell
   Set-ServerComponentState <ServerName> -Component ServerWideOffline -State Active -Requester Maintenance
   ```

### Exchange 2010 SP3

<br>

****

|.NET Framework version|Exchange 2010 SP3|
|---|:---:|
|.NET Framework 4.5|Supported<sup>1,2</sup>|
|.NET Framework 4.0|Supported<sup>1,2</sup>|
|.NET Framework 3.5 SP1|Supported|
|.NET Framework 3.5|Supported<sup>1</sup>|
|

<sup>1</sup> On Windows Server 2012, you need to install the .NET Framework 3.5 before you can use Exchange 2010 SP3.

<sup>2</sup> Exchange 2010 uses only the .NET Framework 3.5 and the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 libraries. It doesn't use the .NET Framework 4.5 libraries if they're installed on the server. We support the installation of any version of the .NET Framework 4.5 (for example, .NET Framework 4.5.1, .NET Framework 4.5.2, etc.) as long as the .NET Framework 3.5 or the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 is also installed on the server.

## Windows PowerShell

- Exchange 2013 or later requires the version of Windows PowerShell that's included in Windows (unless otherwise specified by an Exchange Setup-enforced prerequisite rule).

- Exchange 2010 requires Windows PowerShell 2.0 on all supported versions of Windows.

- Exchange does not support the use of Windows Management Framework add-ons on any version of Windows PowerShell or Windows.

- If there are other installed versions of Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core that support side-by-side operation, Exchange will use only the version that it requires.

## Microsoft Management Console

The following table identifies the version of Microsoft Management Console (MMC) that can be used together with each version of Exchange.
